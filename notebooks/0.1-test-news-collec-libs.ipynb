      "Author: ['Will Is A National Political Reporter Based In Washington.']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2023-09-13 04:01:25\n",
      "Content: LANSING, Mich. (AP) — The prospect of an auto workers strike could test Joe Biden’s treasured assertion that he’s the most pro-union president in U.S. history.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Auto Workers is threatening to strike against the nation’s big three automakers, General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, if tentative contact agreements aren’t reached by 11:59 p.m. on Thursday. That could reshape the political landscape in the battleground state of Michigan and potentially unleash economic shockwaves nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The auto industry accounts for about 3% of the nation’s gross domestic product and as many as 146,000 workers may walk off their jobs. While the effects would be most immediate in Michigan and other states with high concentrations of auto jobs, such as Ohio and Indiana, a prolonged strike could trigger car shortages and layoffs in auto-supply industries and other sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anything that goes beyond a week, you’re going to start feeling the pain,” said Marick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit. “And anything beyond two weeks, that’s when the effects start to compound.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Doc Killian, who has worked in a Ford assembly plant in Wayne, Michigan, for 26 years, says he can no longer afford the cars he helps build, crystallizing how the nation’s middle class has been squeezed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think the American public as a whole realizes the impact that the American auto workers have on the economy,” Killian said. “If we suffer, the American economy suffers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Biden has built his political career around just such an argument, repeating the mantra that the “middle class built America, and that unions built the middle class.” His administration also has championed organized labor and promoted worker organization unabashedly, with Biden frequently proclaiming himself “the most pro-union president in American history.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Shawn Fain, who was elected president of the United Auto Workers in March after promising a more confrontational stance in negotiating with automakers, countered Biden’s claim on CNN this week, saying, “I think there’s a lot of work to be done in that category.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The UAW chief has also sought to broaden his argument beyond just auto workers. He said on a livestream with union members that the UAW’s demands are about “raising the standard for workers everywhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I truly believe that all of America will stand with us in this fight,” Fain said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biden also must contend with blunt criticism from former President Donald Trump, the early leader in next year’s Republican presidential primary, who is now pushing for the UAW to endorse him — an unlikely prospect, according to union leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump posted online that the “once fabled” UAW “will soon go OUT OF BUSINESS” if Biden “is allowed to pull off his ALL ELECTRIC CAR HOAX. China will build them all. ENDORSE TRUMP!” In another post, the former president appealed directly to rank-and-file union members whose support helped him win Michigan in 2016: “Union leadership must decide whether they will stand with Biden and other far-left political cronies in Washington, or whether they will stand with front-line autoworkers and President Trump.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That referenced new federal rules pushed by the Biden administration requiring two-thirds of new passenger cars sold in the United States to be all-electric by 2032. Trump argued those moves would “murder the U.S. auto industry and kill countless union autoworker jobs forever, especially in Michigan and the Midwest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But some union leaders and members have scoffed at suggestions that the U.S. not embrace efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions since manufacturers in China and elsewhere could rush in to produce electric vehicles if the U.S. doesn’t. Fain, who has previously applauded the “transition to a clean auto industry” as long as autoworkers “have a place in the new economy,” said Trump was “not someone who stands for a good standard of living.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave Green, a UAW regional director in Ohio and Indiana, said the former president “carries no credibility in my book” since “he did nothing to support organized labor except lip service.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Green said he still considers Biden the most pro-union president of his lifetime. But he hopes the White House won’t stay neutral if there’s a strike.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t forget,” Green said. “When you’re in distress, the people who are there supporting you — that goes a long way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Biden faced some criticism from labor groups last year when he urged Congress to approve legislation preventing rail workers from going on strike, fearing an upending of supply chains heading into the holidays. But, unlike with rail and airline workers, the president doesn’t have the authority to order autoworkers to stay on the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowhere will the political fallout of an auto workers strike be felt more than Michigan, which Biden won by nearly 3 percentage points in 2020. The state shifted further during last year’s midterms, leaving the governor’s office and Legislature Democratic-controlled for the first time in 40 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michigan since became the first state in nearly six decades to repeal “right to work” laws limiting union activity that had been approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature in 2012. Still, a strike could shake up politics statewide.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The UAW is a major player in Michigan politics and if there is a strike, of whatever duration, it’ll have a political impact,” said Mark Brewer, former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party. A strike, Brewer said, would leave Biden having “to speak and act consistent with his previous advocacy for working people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That might mean alienating other allies, though, since Biden has in the past received support from top U.S. automakers on the administration’s rules over future sales. And Ray Curry, the former UAW president who was unseated by Fain, had worked with Biden in the past, even attending White House ceremonies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biden was nonetheless anxious to meet Fain given the pair’s shared working-class backgrounds, and they sat down together one-on-one in the Oval Office in July. The White House says it has been in regular touch with the UAW since then, and that overall communication is much better now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are engaged regularly with the parties, and of course seek to support negotiations in any way that is helpful,” said Michigan native and longtime Democratic and Biden adviser Gene Sperling, who the president tapped as the administration’s point person on the autoworker negotiations. “But there is no substitute for the parties staying at the table 24/7 to come to what the president wants to be a win-win agreement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Union support was instrumental in helping Biden overcome a slow start to clinch the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and it helped him win not just Michigan but Wisconsin and Pennsylvania as he defeated Trump in that year’s general election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Underscoring his commitment to organized labor, Biden’s lone campaign rally since launching his reelection bid in April came in June in Philadelphia, when more than a dozen of the country’s largest and most powerful unions endorsed Biden for a second term.\n",
      "\n",
      "So many unions banding together for an unprecedented joint endorsement so early in the election cycle was meant as a show of strength for the president. Conspicuously absent from the event, though, was the UAW. Fain has since said that if Biden wants the UAW’s 2024 endorsement, he’ll have to earn it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other union leaders acknowledged what’s at stake for the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are strikes uncomfortable for an administration?” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which endorsed Biden’s reelection this summer. “Of course they are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, she said, “The administration believes in workers and believes that workers have the power to have a better life through collective organization and through collective bargaining.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is not a soundbite to them,” Weingarten said. “This is a belief system.”\n",

      "Author: ['Paul Glader']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2023-09-12 15:06:09+00:00\n",
      "Content: CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll never be successful,” Errol Musk in 1989 told his 17-year-old son Elon, who was then preparing to fly from South Africa to Canada to find relatives and a college education.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s one of the scenes Walter Isaacson paints in his 670-page biography of Elon Musk, who is now the richest person who ever lived. The biography allows readers new glimpses into the private life of the entrepreneur who popularized electric vehicles for the masses and landed rocket boosters hurtling back to Earth so they could be reused.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Musk’s public statements and actions have become increasingly unhinged, filing and threatening lawsuits against nonprofits that fight hate speech and allowing some of the internet’s worst actors to regain their platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isaacson portrays Musk as a restless genius with a turbulent upbringing on the cusp of launching a new AI company along with his five other companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk allowed Isaacson to shadow him for two years but exercised no control over the biography’s contents, the author said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are four key takeaways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk’s upbringing and father haunt him\n",
      "\n",
      "Isaacson’s book attributes much of Musk’s drive to his upbringing. He recounts the emotional scars inflicted on Musk by his father, which, Isaacson writes, caused Musk to become “a tough yet vulnerable man-child with an exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of mission and a maniacal intensity that was callous and at times destructive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk decided to live with his father from age 10 to 17, enduring what Musk and others describe as occasional but regular verbal taunts and abuse. Musk’s sister, Tosca, said Errol would sometimes lecture his children for hours, “calling you worthless, pathetic, making scarring and evil comments, not allowing you to leave.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elon Musk became estranged from his father, though he has occasionally supported his father financially. In a 2022 email sent to Elon Musk on Father’s Day, Errol Musk said he was freezing and lacking electricity, asking his son for money.\n",

      "\n",
      "Musk has referred to his desire to increase the global population as an explanation for his unique family situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book reports that Musk encouraged employees such as Shivon Zilis, a top operations officer at his Neuralink company, to have many children. “He feared that declining birthrates were a threat to the long-term survival of human consciousness,” Isaacson writes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the book presents their relationship as a platonic work friendship, Musk volunteered to donate sperm to Zilis. She agreed and had twins in 2021 via in vitro fertilization; she did not tell people who the biological father was.\n",

      "\n",
      "Isaacson reports that Musk’s fractured relationship with Jenna, who is trans, partly led to Musk’s rightward turn toward libertarianism and questioning what he considers the “woke-mind-virus, which is fundamentally antiscience, antimerit, and antihuman.”\n",

      "Musk team members, such as his business manager Jared Birchall, his lawyer Alex Spiro and his brother Kimbal, sometimes try to restrain Musk from sending text messages or tweets that could create legal or economic peril, according to the book.

      "During Christmas in 2022 with his brother, Kimbal warned Elon about how fast he was making enemies. “It’s like the days of high school, when you kept getting beaten up,” he said.

      "\n",
      "The group of experts gathered by the FDA unanimously voted on Tuesday, declaring ingredient phenylephrine to be no more effective than a placebo pill, reported the Associated Press.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phenylephrine can be found in most over-the-counter medications meant to target congestion, including name brands such as Sudafed, and Dayquil, and became the primary ingredient following a 2006 law limiting access to the older pseudoephedrine, which can be processed to create methamphetamine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The efficacy of phenylephrine administered orally to relieve nasal discomfort has been called into question multiple times in the past, including once in 2007. The FDA allowed the drugs to stay on store shelves at that time pending further research, but this week's findings may finally prompt the organization to demand Johnson & Johnson, Bayer and other drugmakers to pull these oral medications completely, reported AP.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this outcome could lead to the FDA pulling phenylephrine from the federally approved list of pill and liquid decongestants, it is unlikely consumers will see an immediate impact, especially because the panel vote is a suggestion but not a binding agreement or determination.\n",
      "\n",

      "Phenylephrine is a decongestant used to relieve nasal pressure and stuffiness often associated with a cold or allergies.\n",

      "It supposedly works by stimulating alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in the arteries, shrinking dilated blood vessels within the nose. This is meant to prevent fluid in the blood vessels from draining into the tissues lining the nose, reliving congestion, according to Drugs.com. It can also be used to increase blood pressure when administered a certain way.\n",

      "Phenylephrine became the main drug in over-the-counter decongestants in 2006, when medicines with pseudoephedrine were moved behind the counter thanks to the use of pseudoephedrine in manufacturing methamphetamine.\n",

      "What common products have phenylephrine?\n",
      "\n",

      "The major averages all posted losses during Tuesday's main trading session. The Nasdaq Composite was particularly hard-hit, declining 1% as tech names came under pressure. The S&P 500 fell nearly 0.6%, while the Dow ticked down less than 0.1%.\n",

      "Apple slipped 1.7%, weighing on the indexes, and was off another 0.57% in premarket trading Wednesday. Oracle notched its worst day in more than 20 years on the back of disappointing revenue and soft guidance, tumbling 13.5% on Tuesday and another 0.5% in the premarket Wednesday.\n",

      "Economists are estimating a 3.6% year-over-year and a 0.6% monthly rise in inflation, according to Dow Jones. This would mark an increase from the prior month's respective readings of 3.2% and 0.2%. Core CPI, which omits food and energy costs due to volatility, is forecasted to have risen 4.3% from a year ago, compared to a 4.7% annual gain in July.

      "There is currently a notable gap between where the central bank is comfortable with wage growth and the current level of inflation in the labor markets, he said. \"So those are all kind of pieces that the market is going to try and figure out tomorrow,\" Stucky added.\n",

      "Content: In summary About 5,300 companies would file annual emissions reports. The aim is to hold corporations accountable for the role they play in climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "California’s Legislature today approved a closely-watched, first-in-the-nation bill that would force large companies to disclose their annual emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom will now decide the fate of Senate Bill 253. Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villasenor declined to comment today on whether he will sign it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the final weeks of California’s legislative session, business groups, growers and oil companies intensely lobbied lawmakers to reject the legislation, calling it unworkable and likely to lead to inaccurate reports of emissions. Environmental groups, big tech companies Apple, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce, and some global corporations that emphasize sustainability, including IKEA, support it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the bill becomes law, about 5,300 U.S. corporations earning more than $1 billion and doing business in California would be required to annually report their global emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming gases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any company that meets the revenue threshold and sells or produces goods or services in California would have to comply, including such large, global corporations as varied as Amazon, Chevron, McDonalds, Kroger and Walmart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Businesses would have to report not only the tons of gases they emit globally from all of their own global operations and energy use, but also from less-direct sources, such as their supply chains, contractors and even consumers’ use of their products.\n",
      "\n",
      "These indirect sources, called “Scope 3” emissions, have raised the concerns of business groups. Business groups said the estimates could be inaccurate, resulting in misguided public policy, while putting an onerous burden on companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response last week, Wiener amended the bill to give the companies until 2030 before fines for inaccurately reporting emissions from those less-direct sources would kick in. The companies will still have to report emissions from their operations and their energy use beginning in 2026. But the reports of emissions from suppliers and consumers wouldn’t begin until 2027 — and the companies won’t be penalized for inaccurate reports for the first few years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the bill, the emissions disclosures would have to be independently verified by an outside consultant, “an independent third-party assurance provider.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The aim of the legislation is to hold large companies accountable for the role they play in climate change. For years, many businesses have marketed themselves as environmental stewards while failing to fully disclose their emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Increased corporate transparency on emissions could lead to highly publicized “top polluters” lists that make major corporations more accountable — and uncomfortable — since their full role in causing climate change would be exposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bill passed off the Assembly floor on Monday with an initial vote of 41-20, then cleared the Senate in a final, 27-8 vote today. Last year, a similar bill failed in the state Assembly on the last night of the legislative session.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These disclosures are simple but transformational, which is why companies like Apple are already reporting their emissions and calling them essential to their corporate climate goals,” state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco who authored the bill, said in a statement Tuesday. “We need strong transparency to create a level playing field among private and public companies. Once again, California is leading the nation on essential climate action.”\n",

      "\n",
      "NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Arm, the chip designer owned by SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), received enough backing from investors to secure at least the top end of the price range in its initial public offering, which would command a $54.5 billion valuation on a fully diluted basis, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters had reported on Sunday that this outcome was likely. After reviewing investor commitments on Tuesday, Arm decided it will only accept the top end of its indicated $47-to-$51-per-share range, or a price that is even higher, the source said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arm may price its IPO above the indicated price range and will decide on how much it will sell its shares for on Wednesday, that source and a second person with knowledge of the matter said. The shares are scheduled to start trading in New York on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arm was considering publishing a revised price range that would have been higher, reflecting the strong investor demand. It decided against such a move, adhering to its more conservative approach to marketing the offering, the sources said. Pricing the approximately $5 billion IPO conservatively raises the chances of the shares trading strongly at their debut on Thursday, the sources added.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Arm and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The valuation that Arm has been seeking thus far represents a climb-down from the $64 billion valuation at which SoftBank last month acquired the 25% stake it did not already own in the company from the $100 billion Vision Fund it manages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet even with this lower valuation, SoftBank would fare better than its $40 billion deal to sell Arm to Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), which it abandoned last year amid opposition from antitrust regulators. SoftBank took Arm private in 2016 for $32 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arm has already signed up many of its major clients as cornerstone investors in its IPO, including Apple (AAPL.O), Nvidia, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), Intel (INTC.O) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS).\n",
      "\n",
      "Arm launched its IPO marketing efforts last week, seeking to convince investors it has growth ahead of it, beyond the mobile phone market, which it dominates with a 99% share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weak mobile demand during a global economic slowdown has caused Arm's revenue to stagnate. Overall sales totaled $2.68 billion in the 12 months to the end of March, compared to $2.7 billion in the prior period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arm told potential investors in New York last Thursday that the cloud computing market, of which it has only a 10% share and therefore more room to expand, is expected to grow at an annual rate of 17% through 2025, partly thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. The automotive market, of which it commands 41%, is forecast to expand by 16%, compared with just 6% growth expected for the mobile market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arm also told investors its royalty fees, which account for most of its revenue, were accumulating since it started collecting them in the early 1990s. Royalty revenue came in at $1.68 billion at the latest fiscal year, up from $1.56 billion a year before.\n",
      "\n",
      "An area of scrutiny for investors has been Arm's exposure to China, given geopolitical tensions with the United States that have led to a race to secure chip supplies. Sales in China contributed 24.5% of Arm's $2.68 billion revenue in fiscal 2023.\n",

      "Author: ['Winston Cho']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2023-09-12 23:15:50+00:00\n",
      "Content: Authors are escalating efforts to block artificial intelligence companies from using their copyrighted works to train artificial intelligence systems, this time taking aim at and OpenAI in proposed class action lawsuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michael Chabon and other decorated writers of books and screenplays sued Meta on Tuesday in California federal court in a lawsuit accusing the company of copyright infringement for harvesting mass quantities of books across the web, which were then used to produce infringing works that allegedly violate their copyrights. OpenAI was sued on Sept. 8 in an identical class action alleging the firms “benefit commercially and profit handsomely from their unauthorized and illegal” collection of the authors’ books. They seek a court order that would require the companies to destroy AI systems that were trained on copyright-protected works.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawsuit is the latest volley from creators in a barrage of court challenges over the legality of the way large language models are trained. OpenAI is facing a proposed class action from author Paul Tremblay, in addition to a suit filed by Sarah Silverman, which also names Meta. Artists have similarly sued AI art generators Stability AI, Midjourney and DeviantArt for copyright infringement.\n",
      "\n",
      "As evidence that AI systems were fed authors’ books, the suit points to ChatGPT generating summaries and in-depth analyses of the themes in the novels when prompted. It says that’s “only possible if the underlying GPT model was trained using” their works.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If ChatGPT is prompted to generate a writing in the style of a certain author, GPT would generate content based on patterns and connections it learned from analysis of that author’s work within its training dataset,” states the complaint, which largely borrows from the suit filed by Tremblay.\n",
      "\n",
      "And because the large language models can’t operate without the information extracted from the copyright-protected material, the answers that ChatGPT produces are “themselves infringing derivative works,” the lawsuit against Meta says.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors allege that OpenAI and Meta built the datasets they use to train their AI systems by “scraping the internet for text data.” In June 2018, OpenAI revealed that it fed GPT-1 — the first iteration of its large language model — a collection of over 7,000 novels on BookCorpus, according to the complaint.\n",
      "\n",
      "“BookCorpus is a controversial dataset, assembled in 2015 by a team of AI researchers funded by Google and Samsung for the sole purpose of training language models like GPT by copying written works from a website called Smashwords, which hosts self-published novels, making them available to readers at no cost,” the lawsuit states. “Despite those novels being largely under copyright, they were copied into the BookCorpus dataset without consent, credit, or compensation to the authors.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The complaint says that later version of OpenAI’s large language models were also trained on illicitly obtained books. The company disclosed in a 2020 paper introducing GPT-3 that the training dataset came from “two-internet based book corpora,” which it referred to as “Books1” and “Book2.” While OpenAI never disclosed the books in the dataset, the authors say that “Books1” based on the Project Gutenberg archive, an online collection of books whose copyrights have expired, which has gained popularity among AI companies. They allege “Books2” is derived from shadow library sites, including Library Gensis, Z-Library and Bibliotick, because “those are the sources of trainable books most similar in nature and size to OpenAI’s desciption” of the dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI no longer discloses information about the sources of its dataset, “[g]iven both the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models like GPT-4,” the company said last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meta similarly doesn’t disclose the origin of the books in its dataset used to train LLaMA, according to the complaint, which is embedded below. While it said that the works came from the “Books3 section of The Pile,” a publicly available dataset for large language models, it doesn’t further describe the contents.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that information is available elsewhere,” reads the complaint, which alleges “Books 3” is composed of books obtained from Bibliotik. “The person who assembled the ‘Books3’ dataset has confirmed in public statements that it represents ‘all of Bibliotik’ and contains 196,640 books.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The class actions seeking to represent a nationwide class of authors in the U.S. whose work was used to train AI systems was brought by Chabon — known for The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, Wonder Boys and The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay — David Henry Hwang and Matthew Klam, among other writers of books and screenplays. They allege direct copyright infringement, vicarious copyright infringement, violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, unjust enrichment and negligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The courts will have to wrestle with two Supreme Court cases considered by legal experts to likely dictate the outcome of the litigation. On one hand, there’s precedent greenlighting the copying of works to generate noninfringing text responses from when the Authors Guild in 2005 sued Google for digitizing millions of books to create a search function. A federal judge in that case rejected copyright infringement claims, finding the company’s utilization of copyrighted works amounts to fair use. Central to the ruling was that Google only allowed users to view snippets of text without providing the full book.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the authors can point to the Supreme Court’s recent decision rejecting a fair use defense in Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts v. Goldsmith. The justices stressed that potentially overlapping commercial exploitation is a key consideration in the analysis, finding that fair use is likely to be rejected when an original work and derivative share the “same or highly similar purpose” and that secondary use is commercial.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Between the two Supreme Court cases, it looks like the courts are going to focus on the nature of the use,” says Ed Klaris, an intellectual property lawyer and professor at Columbia Law School.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, users can direct ChatGPT to generate screenplays in the style of a specific book or author. “When prompted to produce a screenplay in the style of The Dance and The Railroad, ChatGPT produced a script written in Plaintiff Hwang’s style, which generated a screenplay involving a Chinese laborer toiling on the Central Pacific Railroad that ‘believe[s] in the power of art to keep [their] spirits alive,'” the complaint says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on whether the copyright office authorizes the copyrightability of works generated by AI, with companies listing themselves as the owners under the work-for-hire doctrine, studios could turn to optioning a book and have AI write the screenplay. This would likely undermine the market prospects of authors. Stephen Chbosky, author of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Emma Donoghue, author of Room, and Gillian Flynn, author of Gone Girl, all adapted the screenplays to their novels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Klaris predicts that the courts will “rule in favor of creators” if they get to analyzing fair use. He points to arguments from authors and artists that AI firms are actively hurting their economic interests by creating competing works on the backs of their material. This will force AI companies’ hands in creating a licensing framework, he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI didn’t respond to a request for comment. Meta declined to comment.\n",

      "Title: China’s growth is buried under great wall of debt\n",
      "Author: ['Yawen Chen']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2023-09-13 01:27:25+00:00\n",
      "Content: LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Where is Wen Jiabao when you need him? China’s former premier is remembered for his decision to unleash a huge state spending plan after the 2008 financial crisis. Today’s leaders wish they could deploy similar fiscal firepower to kickstart their sputtering economy. The options before President Xi Jinping aren’t great. Yet letting some heavily indebted local governments’ investment arms fail would be better than keeping them on pricey life support or counting on an elusive rebound in consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wen exited the political stage a decade ago but his legacy lives on, for better and, mostly, for worse. His plan to throw 4 trillion yuan ($555 billion), or about 13% of China’s GDP in 2008, at everything from railroads to airports contributed to a debt overhang that’s still haunting Beijing today. In the 15 years since, China’s debt-to-GDP ratio has doubled to a whopping 280%, with the bulk of liabilities held by local government financial vehicles (LGFVs).\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of these 3,000-plus entities were created by local governments during the 2008 crisis to skirt a central government ban on direct state borrowing. They were then contracted by regional governments to build public infrastructure, from uneconomical leisure parks and roads to slightly more cost-effective highways, subway stations and high-speed bullet trains. Many also developed land for regional governments before it was sold on to residential developers. Today those vehicles are a ticking time bomb that hampers China’s ability to spend its way out of the current economic doldrums. Economists are busy downgrading the country’s full-year growth to below the official goal of around 5%, which was already seen as modest, because an initial recovery following December’s pandemic reopening quickly faded. China is flirting with deflation as the property sector - which accounts for a quarter of GDP – has sunk and pandemic-scarred consumers and businesses hesitate to spend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xi’s dilemmas are compounded by his belief that the traditional stimulus playbook of boosting real estate has run its course. He has frowned at house prices that made Shanghai less affordable than New York and made an example of over-leveraged developers that disrupted the market, such as China Evergrande (3333.HK), which is struggling to restructure some $300 billion in liabilities. He has eased home purchase curbs recently to stabilise property sales, but they are still on course to decline around 10% this year, per Gavekal Dragonomics.\n",
      "\n",
      "That leaves much of the heavy lifting to fiscal spending. Yet LGFVs’ debt stands in the way. These vehicles had already accumulated 80 trillion yuan of liabilities at the end of 2022, according to analysts at Guosheng Securities. Of that, 54 trillion yuan was interest-bearing, mostly owed to Chinese banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters Graphics\n",
      "\n",
      "The bulk of these debts are separated from local governments’ balance sheets, but Beijing's decade-long efforts to sever the implicit guarantee between local governments and their LGFVs have been largely unsuccessful. A third of LGFVs didn’t generate positive cash flow last year, according to Guosheng. And 60% of them, holding about 32 trillion yuan of outstanding debt, would struggle to pay interest with their own EBITDA, Citi analysts estimated. Yet local officials remain reluctant to let them default on public markets, for fear that such a shock would shut their regions’ funding access and even trigger a run on government bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beijing wants to buy time. Its latest move includes a mooted plan to allow local governments to raise 1 trillion yuan in total through bond sales to repay LGFV debt. The Ministry of Finance may also ask banks to extend loans and slash the interest. Zunyi Road and Bridge Construction, a LGFV in China's Southwestern Guizhou province, set a precedent earlier this year, as its creditor banks agreed to roll over its loans for 20 years and halved interest on them. Xi could also help by letting local governments shuffle their debt into the state’s balance sheet since the central government has a debt-to-GDP ratio of just 20%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem with these measures is that they wouldn’t reduce LGFVs’ pile of debt. A harsher medicine is needed. The shock therapy option for Beijing is to force a fire sale to raise much-needed cash. LGFVs have 133 trillion yuan in total assets, around 60% of which are in land and physical assets such as industrial parks, transport infrastructure and investment properties, according to Guosheng.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters Graphics\n",
      "\n",
      "Local officials have pushed back at Beijing's requests to sell, arguing most of these assets are illiquid, according to the Financial Times. But even if the portfolio of land and fixed assets was put up for sale at a massive 80% discount to entice vulture and bad debt investors, that would raise around 16 trillion yuan, enabling the LGFVs to pay back all their outstanding bonds. At a more optimistic 30% discount, the proceeds would jump to 55 trillion yuan, which would cover all outstanding interest-bearing debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with asset sales, it's inevitable that some LGFVs, especially in poorer regions, will have to fail. Beijing fears that would break the banks. S&P analysts calculate that about 20 trillion yuan of LGFVs’ loans may be at risk of restructuring. Letting these loans roll over with interest slashed - as in Zunyi's case - would result in a 5 trillion yuan hit to bank capital, and reduce banks' average capital adequacy ratio by 2.6 percentage points to 12.6%; that's still within regulatory requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stakes are high. Despite Xi's distaste for propping up the economy through real estate, the danger is that a fire sale of LGFVs’ assets could spark a widespread fall in the value of collateral for bank loans and cause a deeper crisis of confidence. That, in turn, might deal a considerable blow to lenders’ balance sheets and destabilise the financial system.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the banking sector is sitting on 335 trillion yuan of total assets, and bad loans, impairments and provisions will only be an issue once lenders come clean on them.

      "UPS CEO Carol Tome introduces U.S. President Donald Trump for an event at a UPS facility at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., July 15, 2020. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "UPS CEO Carol Tome said the costs incurred by the company for the new Teamsters contract are less than the \"$30 billion in new money\" touted by the union, as the company aims to sell investors on the agreement. \"It's not a $30 billion deal,\" Tome told CNBC's Frank Holland in an exclusive interview on Monday. But Tome declined to reveal the internal projection as the company released its first presentation to investors outlining the labor expenses after the bell Monday. UPS said 46% of the compensation in the deal would be in the first year. Tome called the agreement cost-effective and fair. \"It's a barbell structure where it's heavier in the beginning of the contract.\" Tome said. \"We'll go in the middle of the contract and it steps back down. This 46% of the cost increase happens in the first year, so imagine what the last four years of the contract are!\" The increases \"are really good for us and a 3.3% compounded annual growth rate,\" she added. \"That's a deal we'll take every day, but it wasn't just about the money. We've got work/life balance for people, while retaining the ability to deliver on the weekend, which is really important for our customers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Averting a crisis\n",
      "\n",
      "The labor contract reached in July prevented a potentially widespread and disruptive work stoppage. A Teamsters strike would have been the \"costliest in a century,\" creating a $7 billion hit to the U.S. economy in the first 10 days, according to a widely reported estimate from Anderson Economic Group. It also was another milestone in a summer marked by pushes for massive new contracts — and even strikes —‎ in industries ranging from airlines and automaking to television and film. At UPS, full-time drivers will earn up to $170,000 in pay and benefits in the last year of the contract, while part-time workers will see their starting pay rise from $16.20 to $21 an hour.‏ Official negotiations between UPS and the Teamsters began in April, as union leaders urged members to mobilize and create a \"show of force it needs to take on the company.\" In June, Teamsters members authorized a UPS strike during the negotiations. Weeks later, both sides accused the other of walking away from the contract talks. In late July, UPS and the Teamsters announced they had reached a tentative contract agreement. The union ratified the UPS contract on Aug. 25 with record turnout of 58% of members voting and a record 86% approving the deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 'win-win-win'\n",
      "\n",
      "After the tentative deal for the Teamsters contract was reached, Tome called it a \"win-win-win\" for the union, customers and the company. However, UPS shares have fallen more than 14% since the July 25 announcement. Tome also estimated that UPS lost more than 1 million packages per day in volume in the weeks leading up to the eventual deal. \"We can grow now that we have certainty,\" Tome said. \"Because we know what our labor costs are over the next five years, we can put together plans to mitigate that cost, plans to drive productivity inside of our business through automation, which, oh by the way, we retained the ability to do so.\" Tome said the win for customers, as the holiday-shipping peak approaches, is the most important part of the deal. U.S. holiday e-commerce sales are expected to increase by 1% year over year to $273 billion, according to a recent forecast from Salesforce.\n",

      "Author: ['Andrew Bucholtz', 'About Andrew Bucholtz']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2023-09-12 12:35:42+00:00\n",
      "Content: Credit: Charter Spectrum and Disney\n",
      "\n",
      "The Disney-Charter carriage dispute was set up as potentially apocalyptic for both sides. Charter, which provides cable services under the Spectrum brand and had almost 15 million subscribers there before this began in late August, was looking at moving on from Disney-owned channels (including ESPN and ABC) “permanently” without a deal as per their executives’ comments. They had proposed a radically different “glide path” model around a transition to direct-to-consumer subscription services that could have had wide industry impacts on other multichannel video programming distributors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, while claims that ESPN would go “bankrupt” without Spectrum subscribers were always absurd by the numbers, those were advanced by some widely quoted figures. And there was no denying that a permanent Charter loss would have been a major blow to ESPN’s existing linear model and might have had further knock-on effects for other MVPD carriage deals with Disney. The stakes were high here for ESPN as well, and that was reflected in how aggressively they deployed their personalities, including Stephen A. Smith. But in the end, the deal struck Monday to end that 12-day dispute seems to have provided each side some of what they wanted without necessarily transforming anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s more on it from a joint ESPN-Charter press release:\n",
      "\n",
      "In a joint statement Robert A. Iger, Chief Executive Officer, The Walt Disney Company, and Chris Winfrey, President and Chief Executive Officer, Charter Communications said: “Our collective goal has always been to build an innovative model for the future. This deal recognizes both the continued value of linear television and the growing popularity of streaming services, while addressing the evolving needs of our consumers. We also want to thank our mutual customers for their patience this past week, and are pleased that Spectrum viewers once again have access to Disney’s high-quality sports, news and entertainment programming, in time for Monday Night Football.” Among the key deal points: In the coming months, the Disney+ Basic ad-supported offering will be provided to customers who purchase the Spectrum TV Select package, as part of a wholesale arrangement; ESPN+ will be provided to Spectrum TV Select Plus subscribers;\n",
      "\n",
      "The ESPN flagship direct-to-consumer service will be made available to Spectrum TV Select subscribers upon launch and;\n",
      "\n",
      "Charter will maintain flexibility to offer a range of video packages at varying price points based upon different customer’s viewing preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charter will maintain flexibility to offer a range of video packages at varying price points based upon different customer’s viewing preferences. Charter also will use its significant distribution capabilities to offer Disney’s direct-to-consumer services to all of its customers – in particular its large broadband-only customer base – for purchase at retail rates. These include Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, as well as The Disney Bundle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for the moment, the deal means Charter gets some of the “free Disney streaming apps” they had lobbied for, but not all of them. They only get to provide ESPN+ for free in a higher tier than their normal tier, and while that basic tier now comes with Disney+, that’s the ad-supported version. And they get no discount on Hulu.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Charter does get to pull a lot of Disney channels that do have programming duplicated on Disney+ and Hulu, including Baby TV, Disney Junior, Disney XD, Freeform, FXM, FXX, Nat Geo Wild, and Nat Geo Mundo. And they get to offer that linear ESPN DTC service when it launches in 2025 or 2026 (although, there’s as yet been no mention of that service offering anything more than linear ESPN, which Charter already offers under this deal). And they get unspecified “flexibility” on video package range, which could presumably let them offer cheaper packages without ESPN and/or some of its networks (similar to what they’ve done with entertainment-focused packages without RSNs and league networks).\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, ESPN networks and ABC are now back on Charter, and they get to again add in those subscribers who haven’t yet canceled. And that’s a big boost for them on multiple fronts. Firstly, it boosts their income from per-subscriber fees, regardless of whether those subscribers ever watch anything on those channels. Secondly, it improves the household reach for ESPN and its networks. Thirdly, it jacks up the ratings (and thus, the advertising dollars) for ESPN broadcasts. So this is quite important for the futures of Disney and ESPN.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this is a deal that has some merits for both sides, but not one likely to transform the TV ecosystem (as some had expected it might). Both sides gave a bit, and both sides have some things to be happy with out of this. And this could pay further benefits down the road. Charter did get some of what they were looking for in terms of access to Disney OTT apps for their subscribers, and they and Disney could both benefit from Charter marketing the unincluded versions of Disney DTC apps to Spectrum subscribers.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it’s notable that Charter has secured full ESPN linear DTC access for subscribers when that launches. While that’s currently worth next to nothing (it’s just the ESPN feed already being offered through their cable package, so this would just be an alternate way to watch it, and authentication-required web streaming is already a thing), it’s a useful hedge in case Disney tries to throw more exclusive content in there (ESPN++, anyone)? Meanwhile, Disney now has Charter and their subscribers (and their juicy per-subscriber fees) locked in for a while, helping them maintain their linear offerings while they try to ramp up their direct-to-consumer offerings.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this deal alone is not going to blow up the existing model in favor of either side. It may well present a useful pathway for future carriage negotiations, and it certainly seems likely that other MVPDs may be able to get at least this level of OTT app access for their subscribers in future negotiations. But it’s not as radical a departure as people from either side had proposed. While that probably has some merit (the current model still has some benefits for programmers, distributors, and consumers, so an instant implosion carries problems for all), it does mean this deal alone isn’t going to be the watershed some had expected.\n",

      "Author: ['Greg Hadley', 'Sept.', 'John A. Tirpak']\n",

      "\n",
      "Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. and contractor Northrop Grumman both unveiled new imagery of the secretive B-21 Raider, the first glimpse of the stealthy bomber in months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two Air Force images, released during Brown’s keynote address at AFA’s Air, Space & Cyber Conference and dated July 31, showcase the bomber at Northrop Grumman’s Palmdale, Calif., facility. Notably, one shows the B-21 outdoors, a rare sighting of the aircraft outside the hangar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Separately, Northrop Grumman announced Sept. 12 that the B-21 has begun engine runs as part of its ground testing program and released another picture of the aircraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most prominent new feature shown in the new images is an air data probe mounted on the front of the aircraft below the nose; a test item which will not be a feature of operational aircraft. The probe is angled downwards, suggesting the airplane may fly with a slight pitch-up attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "The B-21 Raider is designed with an open systems architecture, enabling rapid insertion of mature technologies and allowing the aircraft to be effective as threats evolve. The B-21 first flight is anticipated to take place in calendar year 2023. U.S. Air Force photo\n",
      "\n",
      "The images also emphasize how narrow the air intakes on the aircraft are—a marked contrast to the Air Force’s other stealth bomber, the B-2 Spirit—as well as the B-21’s simpler landing gear doors. The photos also appear to show the B-21’s flight control surfaces for the first time, seemingly three per side of the flying wing aircraft, and they seem larger than those on the B-2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outdoor image of the B-2 also reveals a serrated indentation on the top of the airframe behind the cockpit. The feature may be part of the air refueling receptacle system, which is in a similar position on the on the B-2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The side windows of the B-21 seem smaller, wider and lower than was suggested in earlier artist’s concepts. A dark band sloping up onto the fuselage from the tail could be an extension of an infrared suppression system similar to that on the B-2, which uses space shuttle-tile-like materials to trap and disperse heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Air data sensors like those on the B-2 are prominent on the front of the aircraft in the hangar image. Black bands prominent beneath the windscreen could be air data sensors, a de-icing feature, or both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using ground crew in the hangar photo as a gauge, the aircraft appears to have a wingspan of approximately 135-155 feet, versus 172 feet for the B-2.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The Air Force rolled out the B-21, its first new bomber in more than three decades, in December 2022 at Northrop’s plant in Palmdale. The flashy ceremony, attended by Pentagon dignitaries, industry officials, and media, showcased some new features on what Northrop is dubbing the world’s first “sixth-generation” aircraft but also kept the general public at a distance from the secretive plane, whose full capabilities are still classified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in March, the service released two more images of the B-21. Since then, however, there has been no sight of the bomber emerging from the hangar, either for ground or flight tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Northrop did announce in July that the bomber accomplished its first “power on” test in recent months, moving it another step closer to a first flight that is still scheduled to take place before the end of 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "No firm timeline has been set for that first flight, and in its most recent release, Northrop emphasized that it would be a “a data driven event.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In his speech, Brown highlighted the B-21 as “a perfect example of successful design implementation, of operators and acquisition professionals working together to deliver capability to the warfighter. Just as importantly, developing the maintenance processes to ensure aircraft availability.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Air Force Global Strike Command has Airmen working to do that right now,” Brown added. “Airmen like Staff Sgt. Ashley Ross, ensuring the capability we need is supportable and maintainable Day One.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Air Force officials have said the B-21 incorporates advancements in low-observance maintenance, typically an involved and difficult process, making the aircraft easier to repair and maintain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The B-21 Raider will be the backbone of the bomber fleet and will incrementally replace the B-1 and B-2 bombers as sufficient numbers of B-21s are available. The state-of-the-art bomber will provide survivable, long-range, penetrating strike capabilities to deter aggression and protect the United States, allies, and partners. The B-21 first flight is anticipated to take place in calendar year 2023. U.S. Air Force photo\n",
      "\n",
      "In his own keynote speech Sept. 11, Air Force Materiel Command boss Gen. Duke Z. Richardson also highlighted the work of maintainers on the B-21.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Transitioning from developing, acquiring, and testing to maintenance, our Air Force Sustainment Center steps in to provide essential logistic support,” Richardson said, before introducing a video of maintainers sharing their “real-world, wrench-turning stories.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have been involved with the program since pre-source selection,” said Lauren Hazen, squadron director of the 556th Software Maintenance Group. “We actually had multiple technical experts working with the Rapid Capabilities Office to be part of that process, to really talk about lessons learned we’ve had on previous programs and to help develop plans to make sure we had a good process for the future.”\n",

      "Author: ['Benj Edwards']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2023-09-12 22:41:55+00:00\n",
      "Content: Coca-Cola has taken a fizzy leap into the future of AI hype with the release of Coca‑Cola Y3000 Zero Sugar, a \"limited-edition\" beverage reportedly co-created with artificial intelligence. Its futuristic name evokes flavor in the year 3000 (still 977 years away), but its marketing relies on AI-generated imagery from 2023—courtesy of the controversial image synthesis model Stable Diffusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stable Diffusion, a technology which is mentioned by name when launching the \"Coca-Cola Y3000 AI Cam\" mobile app, gained its ability to generate images by scraping hundreds of millions of copyrighted works found on the Internet without copyright holder permission and is currently the subject of litigation related to copyright infringement.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is no hint of that controversy in Coca-Cola's marketing materials, which lean heavily into today's buzzy, AI-centered tech zeitgeist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We hope that Coca‑Cola will still be as relevant and refreshing in the year 3000 as it is today, so we challenged ourselves to explore the concept of what a Coke from the future might taste like—and what kind of experiences would a Coke from the future unlock?\" Oana Vlad, Coke's senior director of global strategy, said in a press release.\n",
      "\n",
      "To explore that hypothetical future, Coca-Cola developed a mystery flavor and wrapped it in an AI-themed marketing package and mobile web-based app that draws upon both human designers and the aforementioned Stable Diffusion. There's no direct reference to AI being used to develop the flavor beyond this one statement: \"Fans’ perspectives from around the world, combined with insights gathered from artificial intelligence, helped inspire Coca‑Cola to create the unique taste of Y3000.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "The lack of an AI mixologist at the helm is probably a good thing because AI has been known to concoct questionable recipes. Nobody needs toxic ingredients accidentally confabulated into their soda recipe. (Would Coca-Cola feed its vaulted top-secret recipe through a commercial cloud AI model, such as ChatGPT, anyway?)\n",
      "\n",
      "While there may be no AI flavors involved, the company talks about using AI to develop Y3000's graphical branding: \"Coca‑Cola Y3000 Zero Sugar sports an equally futuristic—and optimistic—visual identity. Co-created with artificial intelligence, the design showcases liquid in a morphing, evolving state, communicated through form and color changes that emphasize a positive future.\"\n",

      "The graphic design is not the only place Stable Diffusion plays a part in the Y3000 marketing package. On its website, Coca-Cola provides an AI-augmented QR code (likely generated with a recently discovered Stable Diffusion technique). When scanned on a mobile phone, the code takes thirsty users to the \"Coca‑Cola Creations Hub,\" where they can take photos with their device camera and filter them through Stable Diffusion to have a vaporwave-style futuristic look.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it stands today, the term \"artificial intelligence\" is a technical term of art, yet it's also arguably sometimes meaningless due to misunderstandings and misuse. Now that it has become marketing jargon for a multinational food and beverage company, the trend toward watering down AI's meaning seems likely to continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coca-Cola says that the zero-sugar version of the new AI-augmented soda will be available for a limited time in \"select markets\" including the United States, Canada, China, Europe, and Africa. Thirsty futuristic folks in US, Canada, and Mexico will also be able to buy an \"original taste version\" of Coca‑Cola Y3000 soon.\n",

      "The deal includes the sale of the QFC, Carrs and Mariano’s banners to C&S, as well as a licensing arrangement that would allow C&S to use the Albertsons brand name in Arizona, California, Colorado and Wyoming, according to announcements from the companies.

      "“Because we are still in the regulatory process, we are not able to share the specific locations included in the agreement,” Sanders said in a statement.\n",

      "Content: Amazon is the latest tech giant to buy into the idea of filtering carbon dioxide out of the air as a way to combat climate change. The company is backing an oil giant, Occidental Petroleum, to help it do just that. Amazon announced today that it plans to purchase 250,000 metric tons of carbon removal from Occidental subsidiary 1PointFive.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the latest in a stream of announcements from Big Tech companies turning to emerging carbon removal technologies to help them meet their climate goals. Sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere is one way to try to undo the damage caused by pollution companies have already created. But much of the carbon removal industry has deep ties to oil and gas. And when companies like Amazon pay to deal with their pollution this way, it doesn’t necessarily stop them from continuing to create more of the pollution by burning fossil fuels.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the latest in a stream of announcements from Big Tech companies turning to emerging carbon removal technologies to help them meet their climate goals\n",
      "\n",
      "1PointFive, the subsidiary of Occidental, has plans to build massive industrial facilities, called direct air capture (DAC) plants, in Texas that are supposed to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Amazon says that the CO2 will then be sequestered underground to keep it from escaping back into the atmosphere. Occidental, however, has also used carbon removal to sell what it calls “net-zero oil,” produced by shooting CO2 into the ground in order to push out hard-to-reach oil reserves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Biden administration has arguably been just as jazzed about carbon removal as tech companies have. The Department of Energy (DOE) chose to fund a project 1PointFive is developing at King Ranch in Texas as the site of one of the first “hubs” for direct air capture plants in the US. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed in 2021 earmarks $3.5 billion in federal funding for at least four DAC hubs across the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, Microsoft announced that it would purchase 315,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide removal from another hub the DOE is funding in Louisiana. That project is led by California startup Heirloom and Swiss company Climeworks. Climeworks was one of the first companies in the world to build CO2-sucking industrial plants and has already captured an unspecified amount of CO2 for Microsoft, Stripe, and Shopify at its facility in Iceland.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of its carbon removal purchase from Occidental’s 1PointFive, Amazon also said today that it is “making an investment” in another California-based DAC company called CarbonCapture that will provide Amazon with credits worth 100,000 tons of carbon removal. CarbonCapture is building another big direct air capture plant in Wyoming. But there’s a key difference. Both CarbonCapture and Climeworks have previously told The Verge that they have no plans to use their technology in tandem with oil production in the way that Occidental has.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon’s announcement today is a pretty big purchase for the burgeoning carbon removal industry, but it still represents a fraction of the company’s greenhouse gas emissions. By The Verge’s estimate, Amazon’s purchase from 1PointFive could add up to as much as $150,000,000 (direct air capture typically costs around $600 per ton of CO2, although policymakers are trying to bring that price down with incentives). Occidental also plans to use Amazon Web Services to “analyze real-time performance data and optimize operations” at its future DAC plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wall Street Journal estimated that Microsoft’s purchase from Heirloom last week cost around $200 million. While that might be a lot of money, the amount of carbon dioxide Microsoft and Amazon are paying to capture still pales in comparison to how much climate pollution they continue to produce.\n",

      "Content: Mark Smucker, CEO of food and beverage manufacturer J.M. Smucker , discussed his company's acquisition of Twinkie maker Hostess Brands on Monday with CNBC's Jim Cramer. Smucker said this move will help the company expand its snack offerings, noting how the two brands complement each other.\n",

      "\"We complement each other so well.

      "\n",
      "Emanating from the dense maze of pipes and towers the size of a city block is the roar of carbon dioxide escaping into the atmosphere — exactly what Chevron Corp.’s ambitious $2.1 billion system was supposed to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gorgon project sits 60 kilometers (37 miles) off the northwest coast of Australia next to a vast gas field. Chevron received approval to develop the site into a major liquefied natural gas export facility on the basis they could capture and store 80% of the CO2 mixed in with the fuel, instead of releasing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since LNG production started in 2016, they mostly haven’t. Mitigation operations started late, ran in spurts and were beset with technical issues. Right now, while the facility is successfully capturing CO2, it is only storing 1.6 million tons per year, under half its 4 million tons capacity, after struggling to inject the gas into the ground reliably.\n",

      "Carbon capture and storage is one of the most contentious solutions in the drive to cut greenhouse gas emissions. In the last three decades, according to BloombergNEF data, governments and corporations have poured over $83 billion into projects. Last year the technology captured just 0.1% of global emissions.\n",

      "Yet enthusiasm at Chevron, the second-biggest US oil and gas producer, is undimmed. It’s planning to press on, spending even more money on the divisive technology, both at Gorgon and elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We gotta get started and really get going,” said Chris Powers, vice president of carbon capture, utilization and storage at Chevron’s New Energies unit and the company veteran charged with getting Gorgon back on track. “These are multi-year projects that are gonna take, many, many, many millions of dollars to progress.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest problems is that unlike technologies such as solar, which have reached mass scale and are now close to drop-in solutions, CCS is still a bespoke suite of processes. It’s expensive, site-specific and has needed custom engineering virtually everywhere it’s been tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many environmentalists say the technology should be abandoned, arguing it is simply a way for the fossil fuel industry to justify its continued existence and to avoid having to write down the value of its assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet CCS is also one of the world’s last best hopes to limit dangerous warming.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world is filled with high-emission, high-cost infrastructure like power stations and factories that cannot be easily scrapped in favor of green alternatives. In some cases, because the assets were recently built in cash-strapped countries who can’t afford to decommission them. In others, because there isn’t yet a commercially viable way for industries like cement and steel smelting to decarbonize. If CCS technology can be retrofitted, the world gains valuable time.\n",
      "\n",

As projects normally take five to seven years from announcement to commissioning, that gives the industry just two years to build trust in CCS and significantly scale-up investment. Some $4.5 trillion is needed by 2030, according to BloombergNEF.\n",

      "In the early-1970s Chevron made history by injecting leftover CO2 captured from an oil field to produce more fuel at scale. Usually, the gas would have been vented but instead engineers used it like soap to squeeze out extra oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next 30 years this was the main application of carbon capture: not constraining greenhouse gas emissions but producing even more fossil fuels. Then as concerns about global warming gathered pace, the industry started to experiment with using CCS to operate refineries and gas fields with a lower carbon footprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s been a frustrating journey. Some 78% of large-scale demonstration and pilot projects initiated between 1995 to 2018 have been canceled or put on hold, according to a 2021 study. High costs were a key issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IEA says that currently 40 projects globally are capturing carbon at a commercial level. That’s in sharp contrast to the exponential increase in wind and solar installations.\n",
      "\n",
      "One project the industry often touts as a success is Quest in Scotford, Canada, operated by Shell Plc. It handles emissions from a facility that creates hydrogen to upgrade bitumen from oil sands fields, allowing the thick fuel to be refined into products like gasoline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shell’s Quest carbon capture and storage project in Scotford, Canada. Photographer: Jason Franson/Bloomberg\n",
      "\n",
      "Built on time and under budget, it’s operated near its full 1 million tons a year capacity for the first seven years of operation – although the actual volume of avoided emissions is lower because the site generates other pollution that is not captured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Learning from Quest’s construction, Shell hopes to use modularized designs and existing technologies in future endeavors, reducing the need for heavily engineered systems tailored for individual projects. That approach could also help cut costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't talk about CCS, we are doing CCS,” said Zoe Yujnovich, head of Shell’s integrated gas and upstream business, which is responsible for exploration and production. CCS is “absolutely critical for my business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Quest is also one of the projects that Chevron’s Powers, 43, a jovial chemical engineer by training, is looking to for lessons. Weeks before he started the role, Chevron announced that it aims to capture and offset 25 million tons per year by 2030, equivalent to about six Gorgons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Powers — like much of the wider oil and gas industry — says making CCS work is non-negotiable if the world wants to maintain its current style of living.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I just fundamentally don’t believe that society is willing to sort of go back to the Old West or Stone Age,” said Powers. “We’re doing an important thing here to feed the growing demand of energy in the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Powers is a third-generation oil man. His grandfather did construction work on refineries and chemical plants. His father was a chemical engineer involved in the processing of hydrocarbons. “And now we’re capturing CO2 that’s critical to the quality of life that we all have, and putting it back to the ground — that’s the personal story I tell folks, it’s sort of full cycle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Most CCS projects share some core elements. They use chemical solvents to remove CO2 in towers; pipes to cool, heat and transport the gas; and then pressurized systems to store it, often within hollow natural caverns that were once home to fossil fuels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineering in remote locations always requires some degree of ingenuity. On Barrow Island, for example, the equipment that flares gas — an approach used in emergencies to relieve dangerous pressure build-ups — had to be separated to be further inland and surrounded by massive black walls so that turtles wouldn’t think it’s the moon and use it to navigate the island.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet when it comes to CCS, the degree of customization required is extreme.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Gorgon back in 2017, trace amounts of water in the pipes transporting the CO2 triggered an acidic reaction that was rapidly eroding the equipment. Chevron had to stop all CO2 transport until engineers finally decided they could fix the problem by installing machines that dehydrated the CO2. That delayed start-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is not a cookie cutter technology,” said Christina Ng, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a non-profit which advocates for a transition away from fossil fuels. “It is so specific, it is so sensitive to the location which it is put in, it cannot be replicated easily to just anywhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, issues with water and pressure management when injecting CO2 are plaguing the facility. Solutions being reviewed include removing and transferring water into another reservoir nearby, allowing CO2 to be injected at a higher rate. The price tag is still being determined.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, to make-up for the shortfall, Chevron must buy millions of tons of carbon offsets, including from a market that’s been criticized for failing to abate greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the industry’s difficulties, all around the world governments are doubling down. President Joe Biden’s US Inflation Reduction Act contains the provision for tax credits which could cover the cost of building and operating carbon capture facilities. The UK is committing as much as £20 billion to subsidize CCS over the next two decades, while the European Union aims to inject 50 million tons a year by 2030 — a 66% increase on what is currently planned.\n",
      "\n",
      "G-20 leaders gathering in New Delhi agreed to support the expansion of abatement technologies, reflecting a wider retreat from ambitions to rapidly phase out fossil fuels. This year’s COP28 United Nations climate summit in the United Arab Emirates will also advocate strongly for the technology. “In any realistic scenario that gets us to net zero, carbon capture technology will have a role to play,” COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber said in a May speech. “Without it, the math just doesn’t add up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And in Japan, CCS is the centerpiece of its transition plan. Instead of pivoting quickly to cheaper wind and solar generation like most of its G7 peers to decarbonize its power sector, authorities are counting on the technology to extend the life and cut emissions from its massive coal and gas plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "By 2050, it plans to have the equivalent of as many as 60 Gorgons operational. It’s a high-risk strategy, because any hiccups threaten to derail efforts to curb pollution in the second half of the century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key to its hopes for a breakthrough are innovation hubs like Omuta, on the southern island of Kyushu. Once home to one of Japan’s oldest coal mines, for over a decade it’s housed a team of Toshiba Corp. engineers. Currently, they are trying to couple CCS with the next door Mikawa biomass plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bio-energy with carbon capture storage in Omuta, Japan. Source: Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the fuel at Mikawa is renewable — it burns palm kernel shells — capturing the emissions would make it carbon negative, at least in theory. The facility runs for short testing periods during the frigid winter and blistering hot summer, providing vital datapoints for Toshiba and Japan’s nascent CCS industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The project is so experimental small metal placards hang off every inch of the plant to let engineers know exactly what each piece does. They chime every time the wind blows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toshiba and its partners plan to liquefy the CO2. Japan is looking to potentially send CO2 to places like Australia, which has more room for storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "For skeptics, CCS is nothing more than a fantasy get-out-of-jail-free card for polluters, sucking up cash that would be better deployed elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s great propaganda in the sense that it gives the user the notion that we can keep burning fossil fuels and not have so many emissions,” said Charles Harvey, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Put the subsidies into the technologies that are good, that work, that are efficient.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And it’s those who stand to gain most who are often the strongest proponents. Toshiba, for example, is also a large supplier of turbines for fossil fuel power plants. Plus CCS is one of the few ways to reconcile environmental targets with the decision by a number of large oil and gas producers to cut output at a slower rate than previously planned in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n",

      "The natural gas the island is now focused on is in high demand as a so-called transition fuel as Asian nations seek to move away from dirtier coal. But Australia is bearing the carbon cost nonetheless: the Gorgon project was the country’s largest polluter during the year through June 2022, according to the latest available data from the regulator.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all the site’s setbacks, there are successes that give the company optimism. Underneath the dusty red earth, pipes are actually transporting some CO2, captured and condensed to a supercritical state, roughly two kilometers underground.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the three injection sites there is no ear-wrenching racket of equipment, or even a modest hum. You’d only know the wells are operating as intended by the constantly changing numbers on small digital monitors.\n",

      "\n",
      "That sentiment sums up the carbon capture industry. For decades, the industry has had something to point at to say the technology works. Yet despite these accomplishments, it’s not currently operating at a large enough scale to make a meaningful impact in slowing down climate change.\n",

      "Publish Date: None\n",
      "Content: Tesla stock (TSLA) popped this week — 6% on Monday — as influential Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas talked up the artificial intelligence and Dojo supercomputer prospects for the electric vehicle maker. The Dojo effect will be even bigger on the so-called Muskonomy, which Jonas dubbed the other companies in the Musk empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "But first, a primer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla's Dojo supercomputer consists of several \"system trays\" of the company’s in-house D1 chips, which are built into cabinets that then merge into an \"ExaPOD\" supercomputer. Several ExaPODs can be strung together in clusters, making even more powerful supercomputers.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Morgan Stanley, a version of the Dojo supercomputer has been up and running since July and will eventually have the power to crunch FSD (full-self driving) visual data from the 400,000+ vehicles running FSD software, in order to train Tesla’s AI model and FSD chips inside every Tesla vehicle. This is what Tesla had in mind for Dojo — to accelerate its self-driving and other AI-driven software initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will the \"Muskonomy\" rule the world? Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla, in Paris in June. (REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes)\n",
      "\n",
      "But Musk has said recently that Tesla also envisions a scenario where it can use Dojo as a cloud SaaS (software as a service) supercomputer for other companies, and charge hefty fees for its use, like Amazon (AMZN) does with its AWS cloud product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jonas believes Tesla’s Network Services (SaaS/Dojo cloud services) will not only be a revenue driver for the company, but also will help boost the prospects of Musk’s other businesses: X (formerly Twitter), SpaceX, Tesla’s battery business, and even Neuralink and the Boring Company. This is what Jonas calls the \"Muskonomy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We think that there's a possibility that the Dojo system isn’t just being built to accelerate and train FSD and Optimus (Tesla bot); rather it could be a solution that builds a moat around Tesla and Musk-universe companies with highly advanced ML (machine learning) and AI capabilities,\" Jonas wrote to his clients. \"Looking internally at other Musk companies, we believe that Dojo may have the capability to be the core of the Muskonomy.\"\n",

      "Story continues\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla's Dojo Supercomputer ExaPODs (credit: Tesla)\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, \"Twitter can benefit from shifting away from its current compute systems and switching to no/low-cost data computation from the most powerful supercomputer systems in the world, greatly accelerating the platform to new heights,\" Jonas wrote. Owning and operating a free speech platform like Twitter/X provides a number of challenges — and supercomputing has the potential to handle multiple tasks like content moderation for example, and perhaps even advertising optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "SpaceX is another company, with its vast array of satellites, that could benefit from supercomputer capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since the satellites communicate through lasers, large amounts of data is required for precise measurements needed to connect and hand off [data to other satellites],\" Jonas said, adding that \"immense computational power is required in the field of orbital debris mitigation and avoidance for the satellites need to avoid collisions, where the required metrology can benefit from AI computations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, battery design and construction can require a substantial amount of supercomputer and AI power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive analysis from Dojo can be used to model the thermal properties of batteries, magnetic fields, and chemical reactions needed to design batteries, and to test theoretical designs. And yes, another off-the-shelf product that Tesla could offer to other EV makers down the line.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against broker-dealer Virtu Americas LLC and its parent company, Virtu Financial Inc. (collectively, Virtu), for making materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding information barriers to prevent the misuse of sensitive customer information.\n",
      "\n",
      "As alleged in the SEC's complaint, Virtu Americas and its affiliates operated two businesses that it purported to have walled off from each other: an order execution service for large institutional customers, whereby Virtu Americas executed customer orders, typically for a commission, and a proprietary trading business, through which Virtu Americas bought and sold securities for its own accounts and benefit. From approximately January 2018 through the beginning of April 2019, however, Virtu Americas allegedly failed to safeguard a database that contained all post-trade information generated from customer orders routed to, and executed by, Virtu Americas, including customer identifying information and other material nonpublic information. The SEC’s complaint alleges that this database was accessible to practically anyone at Virtu Americas and its affiliates, including their proprietary traders, through two sets of widely known and frequently shared generic usernames and passwords. Virtu Americas’ failure to safeguard this information created significant risk that its proprietary traders could misuse it or share it outside Virtu Americas. For example, a Virtu Americas proprietary trader allegedly could observe that Virtu Americas had executed the orders of a large institutional customer throughout the day, understand that the same customer may follow a similar trading pattern over the next days, and take advantage of such information by trading ahead of the customer’s subsequent orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, during this fifteen-month period when Virtu Americas failed to establish, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of that information, Virtu misled customers about the existence and adequacy of such information barriers. As alleged in the SEC’s complaint, in some instances Virtu overstated the controls, barriers and processes it had in place to secure its institutional customers’ post-execution trade data, and in others falsely represented to those customers that only employees with a need to see such information – a group that did not include proprietary traders – could do so. Following these false and misleading statements, a number of institutional customers continued to use Virtu Americas to execute their orders, resulting in significant commissions for Virtu Americas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At a time when Virtu Americas handled around a quarter of all market orders placed by retail investors in the U.S., we allege that proprietary traders had nearly unfettered access to material nonpublic information about its institutional customers’ trades – information which could be abused for personal gain,” said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “Despite the absence of any critical safeguards whatsoever around this information, we further allege that Virtu repeatedly misled institutional customers and the market about how Virtu Americas was protecting this valuable data to generate significant commissions. Today’s enforcement action not only holds Virtu accountable for its failings, but also sends a strong message to firms that they must do much more than use shared, generic usernames and passwords to protect against and prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Virtu allegedly painted a materially misleading picture as to the safeguards it had in place to protect its customers’ confidential information, even when customers specifically asked about the firm’s handling of their post-trade information,” said Carolyn M. Welshhans, Associate Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division. “As our enforcement action shows, the SEC is committed to ensuring that firms provide accurate information for customers to make their investment decisions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The SEC’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Virtu violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and that Virtu Americas violated Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Alexandra M. Arango and David Bennett of the Market Abuse Unit, and supervised by David A. Becker, Paul Kim, Joseph Sansone, and Ms. Welshhans. The litigation will be led by Damon Taaffe under the supervision of James Carlson and James Connor. The Division of Examinations conducted an examination that contributed to the investigation.\n",

      "Content: Instacart is going public more than 10 years after launching in California and is hoping Wall Street will appreciate its goal to bring \"the grocery industry online and help make grocery shopping effortless.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The San Francisco-based company filed paperwork Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), estimating that its stock price will be between $26 and $28 per share, valuing the company between $8.6 billion to $9.3 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's well below the $30+ billion valuation it gave itself in 2021. The company intended to go public last year but pulled plans to do so, citing tumultuous market conditions, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n",

      "INSTACART CUTS INTERNAL VALUATION ANOTHER 20%: REPORT\n",
      "\n",
      "The company was founded in San Francisco in 2012. It started delivering groceries to users in the Bay Area but within two years it expanded to 10 major cities around the nation, including New York City and Portland, Oregon. By 2017, it expanded across North America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, it competes alongside companies like Shipt and FreshDirect, which also partner with various retailers to deliver food to customers' doorsteps. Amazon and Walmart are larger rivals.\n",

      "\n",
      "Despite its rivals, the company says it is the leading grocery technology partner to more than 1,400 retail banners. Those retailers, according to Instacart, account for more than 85% of the U.S. grocery market.\n",
      "\n",
      "CEO Fidji Simo said the company powers \"tens of billions of dollars in annual sales for retailers, which makes Instacart the leading grocery technology company in North America.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have demonstrated our ability to help our retail partners drive strong growth and stay competitive in a complex and increasingly digital industry,\" Simo said in a letter, which was made public in an SEC filing.\n",
      "\n",
      "How it works\n",
      "\n",
      "Instacart is a mobile app that lets users grocery shop directly from their phone app. It crowdsources personal shoppers who then deliver the food from stores in less than an hour, according to the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "INSTACART FILES CONFIDENTIALLY FOR IPO\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2022, the company launched a revamped version of its subscription service, Instacart+, which costs $9.99 per month or $99 per year. With this service, previously known as Instacart Express, the company boasted that users can get free delivery on orders over $35, 5% credit back on all eligible pickup orders and reduced service fees. They can also share their subscription with their household.\n",
      "\n",
      "A digital transformation is underway\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fiscal year ending June 30, Instacart completed 263 million orders with a gross transaction value of $29.4 billion, according to an SEC filing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief executive also noted that it has confidence in the company moving forward, given that a \"massive digital transformation is underway in the grocery industry.\"\n",

      "\"Grocery is the largest retail category and represents a $1.1 trillion industry in the United States alone. But only 12% of grocery sales are made online today,\" Simo wrote. Over time, though, online penetration could even double or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simo doesn't see this replacing in-store grocery shopping but rather aiding a shopper's experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We believe the future of grocery won’t be about choosing between shopping online and in-store. Most of us are going to do both. So we want to create a truly omni-channel experience that brings the best of the online shopping experience to physical stores, and vice versa,\" she added.\n",

      "Author: ['Tod Palmer']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2023-09-12 22:58:18.509000\n",
      "Content: KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Evergy has sought permission to change the default plan for customers who do not select one of four new time-based plans that go into effect next month.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Missouri Public Service Commission ordered Evergy to switch to time-based plans for peak summer hours in November 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, the electric utility is offering four plans for Missouri residential customers — the Standard Peak Saver, the Peak Reward Saver, the Nights and Weekends Saver, and the Nights and Weekends Max Saver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, the Standard Peak Saver — which features high rates from 4-8 p.m. on weekdays and low rates the rest of the week, including weekends and holidays — is the default plan for customers who don’t pick a plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the requested change, Evergy is asking for permission to change the default plan to the Peak Reward Saver plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "It offers less savings during off-peak hours, but also charges a lower rate during peak weeknight hours compared with the Standard Peak Saver plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Evergy has always advocated for customer rate choice and does not support mandated time-based rates,” Evergy’s Chief Customer Officer Chuck Caisley said in a statement. “Customers, elected officials and other stakeholders have clearly voiced their concerns about mandating summer peak pricing, and we appreciate that the Commission is willing to listen to this feedback. We have asked to change the default rate to one that provides a smaller price change during peak times and to allow customers to opt back into an ‘anytime’ rate, like we offer today, before the 2024 summer months.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Evergy also is asking the Public Service Commission to allow for a standard tier rate plan, which is the way it currently charges customers without consideration of the time energy is consumed, in May 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "The utility hopes to offer that plan as “an option for customers who may not be able to make the shifts in electricity usage needed to be successful on a time-based rate plan during summer months,” Evergy said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Evergy wants customers who choose to switch time-based plans to be prevented from switching back to an old plan for at least 12 months, unless they are returning to the default plan.\n",

      "Russian president Vladimir Putin acknowledged in a a speech this week that Russia's inflation problem is bad enough that it has become \"practically impossible\" for businesses to make any plans in the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The president spoke at Russia's Eastern Economic Forum on Tuesday, touching on the economic problems that the nation was currently facing. Russian inflation accelerated 5.15% year-over-year in August, well-above the central bank's 4% inflation target. Prices that high make the economic environment extremely uncertain for businesses in the nation, Putin said, per Reuters.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a rare admission from Putin of Russia's current economic woes. Over the last year, Putin has repeatedly emphasized the resilience of Russia's economy and put up a show of defiance, despite trade restrictions and a soaring military budget biting into Moscow's finances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia's economy is now under pressure to lift interest rates to lower inflation, but keep rates low enough to stimulate the economy and bolster its ruble, which recently slumped to a 16-month-low against the dollar. Analysts are largely expecting the central bank to raise rates again later this week, according a Reuters poll, though the bank already issued an emergency 350 basis-point rate hike in August, which lifted interest rates to 12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it reduces lending opportunities and slightly restrains the economy … but it is a significant factor for inflation risks,\" Putin said of Russia's monetary tightening efforts. \"If we miss a situation that will lead to uncontrollable inflation growth, in the long run it will be even worse for the economy,\" he later added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Story continues\n",

      "Still, Putin brushed off longer-term concerns. Despite the current inflation problem and the plunging value of the ruble, the nation isn't facing anything that isn't \"absolutely insurmountable,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts and observers say that Russia's economy has been significantly hobbled over the past year by western sanctions and the costly invasion of Ukraine. The nation's oil and gas revenue has plunged since the west imposed sanctions on key energy commodities, and under-the-radar economic indicators suggest that Russia's economy has broadly deteriorated since the start of the war.\n",

American Express is expanding its Centurion Lounge network, announcing that it will open a new lounge at New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in 2026. This will be the third Centurion Lounge to join the tri-state area, joining locations at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA). Inspired by New Jersey's history and culture, the new lounge will offer guests an immersive and relaxing experience with a range of unique features such as live music and a cocktail bar influenced by the 20th-century jazz era. CNBC Select has the scoop on what you can expect from Amex's upcoming Centurion Lounge and how you'll be able to get in.\n",

      "What to expect at the Newark Centurion Lounge\n",
      "\n",
      "The Newark Centurion Lounge will be in EWR's new Terminal A and clock in at a whopping 17,000 square feet, which is larger than any existing Centurion Lounge. It promises some unique amenities along with a luxurious design that leans towards a more neutral color palette than the typical Centurion Lounge. Jazz bar and piano lounge It's not common to find live music in airports, let alone in an airport lounge, but American Express likes to do things differently. The Newark Centurion Lounge will boast a cocktail bar inspired by New Jersey's 20th-century jazz era, plus a piano lounge featuring live music. Like the 1850 Speakeasy Bar at the JFK Centurion Lounge, American Express is taking a page out of its book by capturing the essence of a bygone urban era. Archival collection Along with the lounge's musical escape, guests will be able to immerse themselves in the archival collection featuring artifacts and antiques that celebrate New Jersey's culture and history of innovation. Indoor terrace Guests will also be able to enjoy sweeping views from a 1,400-square-foot indoor terrace overlooking Newark Airport's airfield and the Manhattan skyline. Locally-inspired food and drinks Like all other Centurion Lounges, guests can expect a hearty menu that incorporates a mix of local and artisanal ingredients. There will also be a staffed bar where bartenders will shake up complimentary craft cocktails. Wi-Fi and other amenities In addition to food and relaxation, guests can expect amenities like private workspaces, a family room, high-speed Wi-Fi, premium restrooms, shower suites and lots of power outlets. More amenities will be announced closer to the lounge's opening.\n",

      "The German airline will become the 18th — and the first new transcontinental carrier in more than four years — at MSP when it launches the service June 4.\n",

      "\"This announcement from Lufthansa is a reinforcement of the fact that Minneapolis-St. Paul is a global hub for business, and more direct connectivity to the heart of Europe will make our economy more competitive for companies seeking to do business in our state,\" said Peter Frosch, chief executive of the Greater MSP economic development group. \"And it creates new options for business and personal travelers in Minnesota.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel demand to Europe is surging after pandemic shutdowns and as the dollar remains strong, with MSP's dominant carrier, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, expanding international service and more competition on the way. Last month, Aer Lingus announced plans to resume flights to Dublin next spring while Delta will add that nonstop route from MSP around the same time.\n",

      "Content: Mayor Mike Duggan divided his attention equally Tuesday, test driving vehicles from each of the Big Three automakers during a tour of the Detroit auto show, but declined to say much on the possibility of a United Auto Workers strike.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mayor said he hopes an agreement is reached because an \"alternative is bad\" for the autoworkers, companies, city and state.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know everybody's trying hard to reach a resolution and I think everybody in town is hoping they do. We'd be far better off if we came up with something where the auto workers were treated fairly in light of the industry's success, but we need GM, Ford and Stellantis to also be successful. Hopefully they'll reach that agreement,\" Duggan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He declined further comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duggan drove a Ford Mustang Mach-E, road down a steep hill in a Jeep Wrangler and took a ride in an autonomous vehicle during a tour of the Detroit auto show, which will open to the public this weekend at Huntington Place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duggan took the wheel and spun for a lap in a Mach-E after touring various exhibits, focusing mainly on the Big Three automakers while gazing at luxury automakers BMW, Lincoln, and passed up on sitting in a Ferrari Monza SP1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duggan sat inside various vehicles, including a 2024 Cadillac Lyriq, GMC Sierra EV but he particularly eyed a silver and black hybrid Jeep Grand Cherokee, produced in the Mack Assembly Plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duggan later took the passenger seat in a red Jeep Wrangler through a display mimicking a roller coaster, where a driver took him up and down a steep hill, and wrapped around the floor, which was an experience the mayor said would be \"a good one to have your seatbelt on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be in a Wrangler where you think the vehicle is about to fall over, but it takes you very smoothly, it's pretty impressive. I don't remember so many different cars,\" Duggan said about the auto show. \"Any kind of car you think you might want to look at, it's going to be here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The mayor wrapped up with a walk through the AutoMobili-D exhibits before a short ride in May Mobility's autonomous vehicle, adding that the company will begin transporting riders in Detroit in the fall of 2024. A safety driver will sit in the driver seat of an autonomous vehicle to start, Duggan added.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The future is arriving soon. In January, they're going to have a contract to start transporting folks around the city of Detroit,\" Duggan said. \"Detroit doesn't like change very much, we'll come along slowly. We're talking about dedicated lanes, of course what we're doing on Michigan Avenue could really pave the way for autonomous vehicles to share the road with regular vehicles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "More:Michigan Avenue may soon become the most advanced road in US\n",
      "\n",
      "Edwin Olson, founder and chief executive officer of May Mobility, said their vehicles contain multiple lidar sensors, radars and camera to track surrounding directions for road users, obstacles, lanes and more. The first year will serve as a testing and data collection period using three vehicles, and the second year will phase in the service, focusing on populations with issues accessing mobility.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Vehicles like these can help connect people to public transit, providing a Lyft or Uber experience,\" Olson said. \"Every time you can prevent a personally-owned car from coming to downtown, you're reducing congestion, reducing pollution, eliminating parking spaces. And that makes it a win for the city.\"\n",

      "Author: ['Sheri Mcwhirter', 'Smcwhirter Mlive.Com']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2023-09-12 16:35:20.985000+00:00\n",
      "Content: COVERT, MI – The company that owns the Palisades nuclear plant announced that it will restart the 800-megawatt power plant in a deal with Wolverine Power Cooperative.\n",
      "\n",
      "The facility stands to become the first decommissioned nuclear plant to be fired back up in the entire United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holtec International said on Tuesday, Sept. 12, that it entered a long-term power purchase agreement with Wolverine, which committed to buy up to two-thirds of the nuclear energy generated at the facility in Covert Township. Rural electric cooperative project partner Hoosier Energy will purchase the balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly Trice, president of Holtec’s nuclear generation and decommissioning, said they are thrilled to be in this new partnership. He said it’s a “significant milestone” toward reopening the plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The repowering of Palisades ensures Michigan has sufficient energy to meet future demand and mitigate the impact of climate change, while creating hundreds of high-paying Michigan jobs, expanding the local tax base, and unleashing economic opportunity within the region and beyond,” Trice said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said with support from federal partners, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the Michigan Legislature, and the local community, this plan “will soon be a reality.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wolverine provides electricity to rural communities across more than half of the Lower Peninsula from 60% carbon-free sources. Co-op officials said this new agreement will bolster their commitment to provide reliable, affordable, and clean power.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The restart of Palisades offers a practical, long-term solution to electric reliability in our state and aligns with Michigan’s ambitious goals to reduce carbon emissions,” said Eric Baker, Wolverine’s top executive officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plant was closed in May last year when its fuel ran out and the owner sold the facility to Holtec. The new owner has now twice applied for federal money to help get the plant operational again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michigan lawmakers included $150 million toward the effort to restart the Palisades nuclear plant as part of a record $81.7 billion state budget recently passed. The application for federal nuclear program dollars remains pending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: Should Michigan have more nuclear power plants? State study underway\n",
      "\n",
      "The planned restart of the shuttered nuclear power plant near South Haven could bolster Michigan’s carbon-free energy supply and help meet emissions reduction goals while awaiting more wind and solar energy generation to come onto the grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Natural gas power plants have provided a greater percentage of the state’s energy supply following the closure of the Palisades nuclear plant and some coal-fired generation, such as the Weadock Plant in Hampton Township and the shutdown of the D.E. Karn Plant in Essexville.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of nuclear energy is part of Michigan’s carbon emissions mitigation plan adopted last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whitmer’s press secretary said they have been proud to support the work to get this done.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Today’s agreement is a strong step toward restarting Palisades, which would save 600 good-paying, high-skill jobs, continue delivering clean power to approximately 800,000 homes, and support an economic engine in Southwest Michigan,” said Stacey LaRouche, Whitmer’s press secretary.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our state is once again leading by example, as Palisades is on track to becoming the first successfully restarted nuclear power plant in American history. We are showing the world that Michigan will be an epicenter of clean energy production and do what it takes to save jobs, protect local communities, and deliver reliable power to homes and small businesses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But not everyone is excited about the announcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some residents of Palisades Park call this among the riskiest and worst environmental decisions ever made in the nuclear power industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The plant was too expensive to keep running due to costly maintenance issues in which the previous owner was not willing to invest, so the aging plant is now in worse condition than it was when it closed,” said Kevin Flynn of Palisades Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "He argued it is short-sighted to re-open a “badly designed, poorly constructed nuclear reactor that sits on the fresh water supply for millions of residents in Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Power generation at nuclear plants does not generate greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change, like burning fossil fuels does. However, some environmental advocates remain concerned about ecological degradation from needed uranium mining and radiation risk from toxic waste nuclear plants produce.\n",

      "TOKYO/SINGAPORE/TAIPEI, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW), which is making an unprecedented push into chip manufacturing overseas, is taking an increasingly optimistic view of Japan as a production base, two industry sources said, as problems persist at its new factory in Arizona.\n",
      "\n",
      "TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is frustrated in Arizona, the sources said, where it has struggled to recruit workers for the gruelling chipmaking trade and faced pushback from unions on efforts to bring in workers from Taiwan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company has growing confidence in Japan, where an $8.6 billion fab under construction in a chipmaking hub on the island of Kyushu is on track to start producing mature-technology chips in 2024, the sources said.\n",
      "\n",
      "While keen to ensure a smooth ramp up at the first fab, the chipmaker is considering adding capacity and a second fab in Japan, the sources said, which could include the production of more advanced chips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several chip industry sources spoke to Reuters about TSMC's view of Japan and its global expansion on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Successful expansion by TSMC in Japan could give a boost to efforts by the country to regain its lost status as a chip manufacturing powerhouse and support its automotive and electronics industries amid growing regional competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "TSMC said in a statement its overseas expansion depends on factors including the needs of customers, the level of government support and cost considerations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Arizona, TSMC plans to produce advanced chips but a shortage of skilled workers has forced the company to push back production at its first fab by a year to 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any project... will have some learning curve. In the past five months the improvement has been tremendous,\" TSMC Chairman Mark Liu said of the Arizona project last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fabs in the U.S., Japan and Germany, where it is also expanding, are \"inherently incomparable\" due to differences in location, setup and scope, TSMC said.\n",
      "\n",
      "NATURAL FIT\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S., Japan and Germany have offered TSMC billions of dollars in subsidies for it to localise production in efforts to diversify the supply of chips, which are essential to the defence, automotive and electronics industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $40 billion investment in Arizona allows TSMC to add capacity outside Taiwan, where it faces constraints on land, power, water and labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the company views Japan as a more natural fit in terms of work culture, and its government is easy to deal with and generous with subsidies, the sources said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The relationship between TSMC and the Japanese government is mutually beneficial,\" said Lucy Chen, an analyst at Isaiah Research.\n",

      "Content: We apply the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM), a partial equilibrium economic model that integrates global agricultural, bioenergy, and forestry sectors43,44 (Supplementary notes 9). The model is solved in a recursive dynamic manner in 10-year time steps from 2000 to 2050. Following McCarl and Spreen83, market equilibrium is computed by allocating resources to production and processing activities while maximizing welfare (the sum of consumer and producer surpluses) subject to technological, resource, demand, and policy constraints84. Prices are calculated endogenously to balance supply, demand, and trade for each product and region. Agricultural policies are taken into account implicitly through adjustment of agricultural costs to reflect subsidies so that the marginal costs equal marginal benefits, as assumed by microeconomic theory. The policies are then assumed constant over the simulation horizon. Any change in the policies, such as in the subsidy levels, would cause a shift in profitability of the agricultural activities and would lead to a new equilibrium state, with new levels of supply, demand and prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food demand projections are based on the interaction of three different drivers: population growth, income per capita growth, response to prices. Population growth and income per capita growth are exogenously introduced in the model reference scenario. Price effect is endogenously computed, and the final demand in the model is therefore influence by some other assumptions on technology, natural resources, etc. that shape price patterns. Commodity markets and international trade are modeled at the level of 37 aggregate economic regions (Supplementary notes 7). The model’s crop sector includes 18 major crops, and its production parameters are based on the biophysical crop model EPIC85. The livestock sector covers 7 major animal products, and it includes the representation of different International Livestock Research Institute/FAO production systems, agroecological zones, animal types, and management systems based on Herrero et al.65. The modeling of land use explicitly accounts for market dynamics related to scenario features, including both direct land use changes (e.g., domestic increases in the area of a crop in response a domestic demand increase) and indirect land use changes (e.g., within country re-allocations between crops and crop management systems, as well as changes in cropland allocation in other regions as mediated through trade).\n",
      "\n",
      "GLOBIOM covers major greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) based on IPCC accounting guidelines including N 2 O from application of fertilizer and manure to soils, N 2 O from manure dropped on pastures, CH 4 from rice cultivation, N 2 O and CH 4 from manure management, and CH 4 from enteric fermentation, and CO 2 emissions/removals from above- and below-ground biomass changes for other natural vegetation. In the nitrogen flows presented in this study (Figs. 3 and 4) we follow Chang et al. 53. in estimating total nitrogen crop inputs (based on harvested crop nitrogen and nitrogen use efficiency) and manure nitrogen application (based on livestock excretion and manure management efficiency).\n",
      "\n",
      "The forestry sector is represented by the biophysical Global Forest Model (G4M)86,87. G4M model provides the minimum and maximum constraint for the area of abandoned cropland and pastureland that can be afforested. Minimum afforestation is based on reference scenario projections at the regional level; maximum afforestation potential is based on suitability in terms of net primary productivity, at the pixel level. The estimate of the amount of carbon captured is based on the G4M model while the time dynamics of carbon density growth curves, differentiated by climate regions, are based on Humpenöder et al.88. The afforestation is modeled to take place with locally naturally occurring tree species. This allows us to assume improvements in biodiversity consistent with restoration of forest ecosystems. It might be possible to further increase biomass growth and carbon sequestration in certain areas with fast-growing plantations of energy grasses or fast-growing non-native tree species; however, this would have negative implications for biodiversity, besides being dependent on additional carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. Biodiversity benefits could be potentially even higher if restoration would happen into non-forest ecosystems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The afforestation is introduced in forest ecosystems, as constrained by gridded forest mask from the LUH289 dataset and afforestation potentials from the G4M model86. This allows us to avoid negative impacts of tree restoration on other natural ecosystems explored in some previous studies. Bastin et al.61. estimated that global tree restoration potential is about 900 Mha if current agricultural and urban areas are excluded. This study received a lot of attention and created a debate on the trade-offs of tree restoration benefits since majority of the restoration potential was located in natural land such as savanna where it would displace other valuable ecosystems62,63.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prevalence of undernourishment is calculated using three key factors: the mean dietary energy availability (kcal per person per day), the mean minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER) and the coefficient of variation of the domestic distribution of dietary energy availability in a country90. The food distribution in a country is assumed to obey a log-normal distribution, which is determined by the mean food calorie availability and the equity of the food distribution. The proportion of the population under the cut-off point (MDER) is then defined as the prevalence of under-nourishment. The calorie-based food consumption (kcal per person per day) output from the model is used for the mean food calorie availability. The future mean MDER is calculated for each year and country using the mean MDER in the base year at the country, adjusted for the MDER in different age and sex groups and future population demographics to reflect differences in the MDER across age and sex. The future equity of food distribution is estimated by applying the historical trend of income growth and the improved coefficient of variation of the food distribution to the future, such that the equity is improved along with income growth in future at historical rates up to the present best value (0.2). No risk of hunger for high-income countries where hunger is not currently reported is assumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Estimates of the intactness of local ecological communities are based on the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII)91, which measures the local compositional intactness of local communities as impacted by land use, relative to if the region were still covered with primary vegetation and facing minimal human pressures. To estimate the BII corresponding to the land use projected by GLOBIOM, we used the BII model derived from the PREDICTS database92 as implemented in Leclère et al. 22, and complemented by an explicit accounting of the temporal dynamics of BII recovery under restoration actions based on Poorter et al. 93.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the reference scenario (REF), trajectories of socioeconomic variables, income, and population, are based on the SSP2 ‘middle-of-the-road’ development in the mitigation and adaptation challenges space94. It constitutes REF scenario because it assumes that the world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns, with continuation of uneven development and income growth with persistent or slightly improving inequalities45. Throughout the analysis, we assume the current (historical) climate and don’t apply any exogenous climate-specific shocks on crop yield, grassland yield, or animal productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We compare the REF scenario results with the results of a suite of alternative ASF substitution scenarios developed specifically for this work. We implemented the substitution by exogenously reducing the food consumption of ASF products by a percentage of the consumption projected in the REF scenario. The reduction starts in the year 2030 and it is applied gradually to be completed (achieve the maximum level) by the year 2050. Simultaneously to the reduction in ASF consumption, we model an equivalent increase in the production and consumption of the corresponding novel alternatives. As a result, the total consumption of each ASF product and its novel alternative is always equal to the REF ASF consumption of that product. This assumes that the novel alternatives will substitute the ASF products at a ‘one to one’ substitution rate. The production of the novel alternatives is modeled as a process that requires crop feed inputs based on pre-defined recipes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each scenario is characterized by six elements: the substitution rate, the region where the substitution is applied, the ASF product being substituted, the recipe being used to produce the novel alternatives, the assumption on the sourcing of recipe crop ingredients, and the assumption on crop processing and the accounting of by-products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four different levels of substitution were analyzed, corresponding to 10, 25, 50, and 90% ASF substitution by 2050.\n",
      "\n",
      "We implemented the substitution globally or alternatively only within one of 13 macro regions (single-region scenarios): Brazil, China, Former Soviet Union, India, Middle East and North Africa, Other Asia, Other South America, Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, Canada, Europe, United States. A mapping of GLOBIOM model regions into the 13 macro regions can be found in the supplementary material. In a single-region scenario, the dietary change is implemented in one region, while the rest of the world has the same diet as in REF. This setting allows for studying, among others, impacts of changes in demand in one region on consumption in other regions and the net impact of these changes on the studied outcomes. It is expected that lower demand in one region will lead to lower prices, which are transmitted through markets to other regions. Due to lower prices, consumption in the rest of the world might increase, resulting in the net smaller decrease in global consumption and smaller benefits to the environment and other objectives. This outcome is referred to as a rebound effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "In each scenario, either a single ASF product (beef, chicken, pork, or milk) is substituted individually or all ASF products are substituted simultaneously. There are five alternative recipes for beef and two alternative recipes for each of the other ASF products (Table 1). In the single product scenarios, the recipe is selected exogenously and scenarios for each recipe were analyzed. In the scenario where all ASF products are substituted simultaneously, all recipes are permissible, and one is selected endogenously by the model based on the least cost of crop ingredients in the given GLOBIOM model economic region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Table 1 Composition of recipes Full size table\n",
      "\n",
      "Recipe development sought to balance global and regional abundance, efficiency, nutritional quality, and functional role of crop-derived ingredients in dietary replacement of livestock analogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three primary categories were identified as delivering requisite functional attributes of recapitulating meat using crop-derived ingredients: proteins, binders (carbohydrates), and oils. All GLOBIOM crops were assessed against these categories as potential ingredient sources, ranked as high-, medium-, and low-potential and only the medium- and high-potential crops were retained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensuring that the macro- and micro-nutrient profile, as well as protein quality, was consistent with that of the animal analog, we began with a high or medium protein source, and we calculated the amount (in %) of the crop required to reach approximate parity with the animal product being replaced. Next, a high/medium fat source was selected and the % use was calculated, again to meet parity with the animal analogue. Assuming that water would make up approx. 50–60% of meat recipes and approx. 90% of milk recipes, a high/medium carbohydrate crop was selected to make up the remainder of the recipe. If the carbohydrate source also contributed significant protein or fat, the % uses of the other protein and/or fat ingredients were adjusted to ensure that the total macronutrient contents of the recipes matched those of their animal analogs. Next, to ensure that protein quality was not sacrificed, total amino acid content for each recipe was calculated to determine its Amino Acid Score (AAS). The goal was for the AAS to match or exceed that of the animal analogue by achieving as close to a score of 1.0 (truncated) as possible. For reference, the AAS for beef is 0.9495. These protein quality scores were not corrected for digestibility in this exercise. However, all recipes achieved an AAS between 0.9 and 1.0, except for the M2 milk recipe, for which the ability to supplement with additional amino acids was assumed. Table 1 below shows the composition of the recipes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of the recipes calls for the inclusion of a vegetable oil. Six different oil crops are represented in the GLOBIOM model (soybean, rapeseed, sunflower, palm, groundnut, and cottonseed) and the respective oils were considered to be functionally equivalent for the purposes of recipe composition. For simplification, we exogenously assigned one vegetable oil in each of the 37 GLOBIOM model regions, and the choice of the vegetable oil varies between scenarios of global vs. local sourcing of novel alternatives crop ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our recipes allow for the use of more diverse ingredients and are largely agnostic to current recipes on the market, in favor or hypothetical and realistic recipes that could be sourced, manufactured, and scaled globally. One or more modeled recipes are similar to the Impossible Burger and Beyond Burgers which are available in LCA studies96,97, because the ingredients met the criteria nutritionally, functionally, and are within the GLOBIOM crop inventory.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the global sourcing scenarios, we identified the most abundant oil in each market (whether or not produced locally, imported, or produced from imported crops) using statistics for the latest available year98,99. For the local sourcing scenarios, in each market we assigned the most abundant oil produced from locally grown crops, again based on latest available statistics. Table S18 (Supplementary notes 8) in the supplementary material shows the vegetable oil choice in each region and scenario setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, in the locally sourced scenarios, imports are capped at a level equivalent to the level of imports in the REF scenario. This is to simulate the reliance on locally produced inputs into the production of novel alternatives. The import cap is effective on the outside border of the 13 macro regions; trade within those regions in not restricted. In the global sourcing scenarios, no changes or restrictions are applied to the reference scenario trade conditions and quantities. We do not consider trade with the final products of the novel alternatives, which would include all the additional costs, such as labor, and could potentially change the trade flows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The novel alternatives recipes were constructed using processed ingredients such as flours and protein concentrates. In contrast, the GLOBIOM model generally follows the convention used by FAOSTAT and operates with quantities of primary crop equivalents. It was therefore necessary to convert the recipe ingredients into the corresponding primary crop equivalents. The supplementary material shows a detailed description of the processing conversions and yields of processed products and by-products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Different assumptions that can be taken about the fate and potential utilization of the by-products of the conversion of primary crops into processed recipe ingredients give rise to two alternative sets of (processing) scenarios (Supplementary notes 4): inefficient and efficient. In the so-called inefficient scenarios, we assume that none of the processing by-products will find a use in the global food system and we therefore account for the entire amount of the primary commodity which is required to produce a given amount of the processed ingredient. In the efficient scenarios, we assume that all the processing by-products will find a use in the global food system; we therefore account for only the amount of the primary commodity corresponding to the weight of the processed ingredient.\n",
      "\n",
      "We present these alternative approaches as an envelope of possible outcomes; depending on the specific ingredient, by-product, and crop, either the efficient or the inefficient assumption might be closer to reality. Today, several ingredients found in novel alternative recipes are byproducts from grain and protein processing, indicating that some degree of efficiency is likely, whether monetization of coproducts follows or is preceded by the ingredient’s use in novel alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our analysis does not consider the production costs of novel alternatives other than the costs of the crop ingredients mentioned earlier. Production costs would shape prices of the novel alternatives and hence decide about the level their adoption. We impose exogenously the level of production and consumption of novel alternatives and the substitution of ASFs is not affected by the relative prices of animal products and alternatives. We can expect that over time with scale and technological advances, the production costs of the novel alternatives would decrease and that product quality would increase - in line with the assumption of the increasing substitution over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recipes were constructed to match the nutritional profile of typical animal product commodities; however, the nutritional profile of animal products varies regionally. In our analysis, we assume that the novel alternatives have the same regionally differentiated calorie content as the animal products they replace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides meat and milk, the livestock sector also supplies animal fats for human consumption totaling approx. 14 million tonnes globally98. In the analysis presented here, we do not account for this quantity of animal products which would presumably need to be substituted with vegetable oils should a large-scale reduction in animal herds take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, GLOBIOM is a partial equilibrium (PE) model, which means that the relevant sectors (agriculture, forestry and bioenergy) are represented in detail, however other economic sectors are not included, or only represented through an external variable (e.g. price of fertilizer). GLOBIOM assumes that the economy outside land use sectors evolves independently from the policies assessed in the model, following a ceteris paribus approach.\n",

       "'Some residents stranded in Southern California mountain communities by a huge snowfall could be stuck for another week, an official said Friday.\\n\\nA late-February blast of arctic air produced a rare blizzard east of Los Angeles in the San Bernardino Mountains, where thousands of people live at high elevations in forest communities or visit for year-round recreation.\\n\\nExtraordinary snowfall buried homes and businesses, overwhelming the capability of snowplowing equipment geared toward ordinary storms.\\n\\nBy last weekend, all highways leading up into the mountains were closed and have opened intermittently since then to residents and convoys of trucks loaded with food or other supplies.\\n\\nThe estimate by San Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus was an improvement in the outlook for stranded residents, which previously ranged up to two weeks.\\n\\n“We’ve said we could push it out as far as two weeks but because of the state’s efforts and the equipment that’s coming in behind us we’re hoping to drop that down to a week,” he told a press conference.\\n\\nThe sheriff and other officials said progress has been made, but they described severe conditions that, for example, have forced firefighters to reach emergency scenes such as fires in snowcats.\\n\\n“The enormity of this event is hard to comprehend,” said state Assemblyman Tom Lackey. “You know, we’re thinking, ‘We’re in Southern California,’ but yet we have had an inundation that has really, really generated a severe amount of anxiety, frustration and difficulty, especially to the victims and those who are actually trapped in their own home.”\\n\\nSan Bernardino County is one of 13 counties where California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared states of emergency due to the impacts of severe weather, including massive snowfalls that have collapsed roofs due to too much weight.\\n\\nIn the northern part of the state, mountain communities grappling with the conditions have smaller populations and are more accustomed to significant snowfall.\\n\\nResidents and vacationers trapped in the San Bernardino range have taken to social media to show their plight and wonder when plows are coming.\\n\\nShelah Riggs said the street she lives on in Crestline hasn’t seen a snowplow in eight days, leaving people in about 80 homes along the roadway with nowhere to go. Typically, a plow comes every day or two when it snows, she said.\\n\\n“We are covered with five or six feet (1.5 or 1.8 meters); nobody can get out of their driveways at all,” she said in a telephone interview.\\n\\nRiggs, who lives with her 14-year-old daughter, said everyone is working to keep snow and ice off their decks to prevent collapse and making sure the gas vents on their homes are kept clear.\\n\\nShe said the county’s response has been “horrible” and that “people are really angry.”\\n\\nDevine Horvath, also of Crestline, said it took her and her son 30 minutes to walk down the street to check on a neighbor — a trek that normally takes just a few minutes.\\n\\nHorvath said she was lucky to make it to the local grocery store before its roof collapsed several days earlier but hadn’t been able to leave her street since.\\n\\n“I’m getting more upset by the day,” she said.\\n\\nThe sheriff sought to give reassurance that help is coming even if people haven’t seen any plows.\\n\\n“We’re going to dig you out and we are coming,” Dicus said. “We are making tremendous progress. I saw this from the air yesterday. The roads are being cleared.”\\n\\nOfficials said crews were dealing with such tremendous depths of snow that removal required front-end loaders and dump trucks rather than regular plows.\\n\\nCalifornia Department of Transportation official Jim Rogers said crews working 24-hour shifts have removed more than 2.6 million cubic yards (1.9 million cubic meters) of snow from state highways.\\n\\nOfficials described a host of difficulties in reopening smaller roads, including buried vehicles and downed power lines that make progress difficult. Residents were urged to somehow mark the locations of cars.\\n\\nA reopened road may only be the width of a single vehicle with walls of ice on each side.\\n\\n“We are going house to house, and we’re literally using shovels to shovel out driveways to make sure that people have access to their cars,” said county fire Chief Dan Munsey. “As the roads are plowed, you still have a 10-foot (3-meter) berm of snow that you need to make it over.”\\n\\nMore snowcats were being brought in, along with a California National Guard crew that normally works with the California Wildfire & Forest Resilience Task Force on wildfires. The crew will help shovel snow.\\n\\nWhile more heavy snow was forecast to arrive in Northern California early Saturday, Southern California was expected to remain storm-free except for possible light rain.\\n\\n“The weather looks great for the next seven days, and that’s great news,” Munsey said.\\n\\nAbout 80,000 people live in the San Bernardino Mountains either part or full time. The county has not estimated how many people are currently in the mountains because many residences are vacation homes or rentals.'"

He\\'s now a front-runner to lead the Tory party. \\u202a#\\u200eHellFreezesOver\\u202c\\n\\nTheresa May – Boris Johnson\\'s populist approach to the Brexit campaign ticked off quite a few Tory elders, so the real money should be on UK Home Secretary Theresa May to succeed outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron. May is a political heavyweight and is generally respected among the Tories, something Boris Johnson is … um, not.\\n\\nNigel Farage – the once-embattled UK Independence Party leader gets his moment in the sun. Also gets to keep having a political career. And the fact that he quoted \"Independence Day\" in his victory speech made a crazy night that much crazier.\\n\\nMarine Le Pen/Geert Wilders – Charismatic figures with a long history agitating for EU exits, France\\'s Marine Le Pen and the Netherlands\\' Geert Wilders wasted no time calling for their own referendums. Brexit legitimizes their years of saber-rattling, and moves them from the political fringes into the mainstream, where they can do serious damage to the European project.\\n\\nVladimir Putin – Russia\\'s strongman needed this. Low oil prices have leveled the Russian economy, and the International Olympic Committee has banned Russian track athletes from competing at \\u202a#\\u200eRio2016\\u202c. But now he gets to say \"at least we\\'re not Europe.\"\\n\\nNicola Sturgeon – The head of the Scottish National Party delivered on her end from Scotland, where 62 percent of Scots voted to \"Remain,\" though turnout wasn\\'t as high as hoped. She now has political leverage by threatening to hold another Scottish referendum. And if Scotland leaves, the British drought at Wimbledon gets retroactively reinstated.\\n\\nGerman/US relations – Going to get stronger. By default.'"
