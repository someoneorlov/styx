      "Since the Fed began tightening in March, core inflation has cooled. But its slow descent toward the central bank's 2% target has been slow and uneven.\n",

      "One of the most quintessentially American foods — Kraft Singles cheese slices — has landed on the “Do not eat” list. On Tuesday, Kraft Heinz said it is recalling 83,000 cases of its infamous individually wrapped processed cheese slices because they could cause gagging or choking.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement posted on its website, Illinois-based Kraft Heinz said that due to a “temporary issue” with one of its wrapping machines, a strip of plastic film could be left clinging to cheese slices after they’ve been unwrapped, which the company predicts “could be unpleasant” for consumers “and potentially cause a gagging or choking hazard.” Apparently, at least six people have suffered that fate and reported it to Kraft, which decided to take action. There haven’t been any serious injuries reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the company says it identified and fixed the problem machine, it’s still recalling the following products: 16-ounce Kraft Singles American Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Product with a “Best when used by” date of January 10, 2024, and January 27, 2024; three-pound multipacks of Kraft Singles American Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Product with a UPC code of 0-2100060491-3 and a “Best when used by” of January 9, 2024, and January 16, 2024. People who bought the cheese should return it where they bought it for a refund or exchange or call Kraft Heinz to get their money back. Cheese-food lovers: Be safe out there.\n",

      "In addition to the investments in domestic manufacturing, beginning September 25, households will again be able to order four free tests through COVIDTests.gov. These tests will detect the currently circulating COVID-19 variants, are intended for use through the end of 2023, and will include clear instructions on how to verify extended expiration dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "This upcoming round of ordering follows four previous rounds in which ASPR and USPS provided over 755 million tests free of charge to households across the country. These efforts complement ASPR’s ongoing distribution of free COVID-19 tests to long-term care facilities, low-income senior housing, uninsured individuals, and underserved communities, with 500 million tests provided to date through these channels.\n",

      "Author: ['Greg Robb']\n",
      "Publish Date: None\n",
      "Content: Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting resulted “in a pause with a hawkish clause,” in the words of KPMG economist Diane Swonk.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Fed kept its interest rate steady in a range of 5.25%-5.5%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues did not rule out one more interest-rate hike this year. At the same time, the Fed suggested rates will be “higher for longer” and could stay above 5% this year and next.\n",

      "\n",
      "What’s beneath the surface of the Fed’s action?\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are three major takeaways from the Fed meeting from Eric Rosengren, who took part in the central bank’s closed-door deliberations for 14 years as president of the Boston Fed:\n",
      "\n",
      "Fed is fighting against a much stronger economy\n",
      "\n",
      "Rosengren thinks the big driver of the Fed’s decision is that they see a much stronger economy now than they saw in June.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three months ago, the Fed thought the economy was going to be quite weak and they could be passive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, “they are fighting against a much stronger economy. It is a pretty big shift,” Rosengren said, and the Fed “has to be more active” now.\n",
      "\n",
      "A rate hike, if it comes, is more likely in December, not November\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Fed is right and the economy is stronger than expected, Rosengren said he thinks the Fed is more likely to raise rates. But that will likely come at their last meeting of the year in December, rather than their next meeting in early November.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My own inclination would be that we’re not going to get so much information by November that I would think they would need to raise the rate, so probably the probability of raising rates at the December meeting is a little higher,” Rosengren said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rosengren said he thinks the economy won’t be as strong as the Fed thinks and they won’t have to raise rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One of the unknowns is whether the consumer continues to spend. I do think the excess savings from what was going on during the pandemic are coming down relatively quickly.” In addition, student loans are picking up and the probability of a government shutdown looks dramatically higher, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All that would tell me that a lot of the turbulence, along with an auto strike, is going to make it fairly difficult in the near term to interpret the numbers,” he said. That’s another reason he sees December as more likely than November for any hike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing is predetermined\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fed is forecasting one more rate hike, but if “they don’t see anything that’s problematic, they won’t need it,” Rosengren said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Powell’s cautious language just reflects all of the uncertainty in the outlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are not even certain that the next rate move is up or down,” Rosengren said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The way I would view this is the chair has a lot of humility about forecast errors. He’s not willing to assert anything with any kind of certainty,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A majority of the committee still thinks the most likely outcome is they are going to have to increase rates. I am not sure he’s convinced another rate increase is going to be needed,” Rosengren said.\n",

      "Author: ['Samantha Delouya']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2023-09-21 01:15:12+00:00\n",
      "Content: CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "The threat of a strike at one competitor and the bankruptcy of another proved beneficial for FedEx this summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, adjusted earnings for FedEx’s fiscal first quarter were $4.55 a share, up from $3.44 a share this time last year. The company raised its earnings-per-share guidance for fiscal 2024 to a range of $17.00 to $18.50 from $16.50 to $18.50, though on a call with analysts, FedEx’s chief customer officer, Brie Carere, said overall demand is “muted” and the macroeconomic picture “is a little bit softer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We came into the quarter determined to provide excellent service to our customers. Despite the industry dynamics, we achieved that goal,” FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam said. “As a result, we are well positioned as we prepare for the peak season.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The shipping company said its businesses saw a boost from UPS’s negotiations with the Teamsters Union and Yellow Corp.’s implosion during the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPS-Teamsters negotiations helped FedEx\n",
      "\n",
      "FedEx reported that its Express division, which delivers time-sensitive packages, saw operating income increase 18% during the quarter, though revenue declined 9%. For the company’s Ground division, which is its low-cost shipping service, the company reported that operating income grew 59%. FedEx attributed the significant income jump partly to cost reductions and greater efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the Teamsters Union and UPS agreed on a contract earlier this summer and avoided a potentially damaging strike, Carere said FedEx won over customers in its Express and Ground divisions from its chief rival amid the uncertainty of the negotiating process.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We onboarded new customers who valued our service, and were committed to a long-term partnership with FedEx,” she said on the company’s earnings call Wednesday. “As a result, we added approximately 400,000 in average daily volume by the end of the first quarter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My job is to make it very difficult for our primary competitor to win back that share,” she added later on the call.\n",
      "\n",
      "FedEx gained customers from Yellow’s bankruptcy\n",
      "\n",
      "But UPS’s contract negotiations were not the only external factor that helped boost FedEx this quarter. Yellow Corp., a 99-year-old Nashville-based trucking company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief in August.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carere said FedEx’s Freight division “experienced significant improvement in August due to Yellow’s closure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The trucking company’s failure helped take the edge off the quarter for the division, which saw operating income decline 26% during the quarter. The company attributed the decline to a “soft market” and lower fuel surcharges.\n",
      "\n",
      "UAW strikes could have an impact\n",
      "\n",
      "Disruptions caused by unionized autoworker strikes against Ford, General Motors and Stellantis may have an impact in the future on FedEx, which derives revenue from shipping cars and automotive parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We do anticipate that there will be some rolling strikes, and so we have accounted for that within the current demand outlook,” Carere said of the United Auto Workers’ ongoing strikes. “Right now, we believe that both FedEx and the entire economy would benefit obviously from a fast resolution.”\n",

      "\n",
      "According to Skytrax, who conducted their own satisfaction survey, they are “regarded as a quality benchmark for the world airport industry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Skytrax ranked 44 different factors related to airports, such as hygiene standards; lost luggage services; airport website; friendliness of airport staff; security screening; and 38 more.\n",

      "Author: []\n",
      "Publish Date: None\n",
      "Content: Mike Wirth has bad news for consumers. Those eye-watering prices you’re seeing at gas stations? They likely will go even higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chevron CEO believes the current $95 price tag against a barrel of crude oil is set to hit $100—and rise beyond it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It sure looks like [$100 a barrel is going to happen],” Wirth told Bloomberg TV. “We’re certainly motoring in that direction. Supply is tightening, inventories are drawing, these things happen gradually—you can see it building.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, while Wirth said consumers are already “close” to seeing fuel prices hit the $100 a barrel threshold, and trends suggest prices will only continue to rise, he—and other economic experts—believe consumers will be able to handle the pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why are gas prices so high?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oil prices—and as a result gasoline and diesel prices—are rising as a result of political tensions and geopolitical factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In April some members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)—including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Algeria, and Kazakhstan—announced they were going to begin curbing production, slashing approximately 1.15 million barrels a day in a bid to stabilize the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Russia—another oil-rich nation, though not a part of OPEC—has said it will not sell its product either directly or indirectly to the U.S., after the latter placed price caps on the commodity following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The retaliation will do little further harm to prices, as President Biden has already banned Russian oil imports into the U.S., which sent prices spiraling.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, deadly flooding in Libya—another OPEC nation—this month could disrupt the country’s oil supply further, with OPEC claiming the nation usually produces around 1 million barrels a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is gas going to stay this expensive?\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts predict some price easing in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wirth said that the current highs are a sign the market is not mid-cycle, adding the trends haven’t pushed Chevron—the second largest oil company in the U.S.—to change its long-term price expectations for oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We really don’t change [our long-term price] very often,” Wirth explained. “We’ve been in a volatile market really going back to the pandemic when things came down, the recovery when it was high, the war. This has been a period of time where prices have been unpredictable and volatile.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. Energy Information Administration has even better news: although it sees average prices increasing in Q4 2023, this is set to come back down by Q2 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "It explained that Brent crude oil is likely to average $93 per barrel in the final months of this year—with a decline in global oil inventories supporting this hypothesis—before easing to $87 a barrel by mid-2024 as oil inventories rise once again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will oil prices impact the economy?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fed has painstakingly rolled out measures to bring down the level of inflation—despite an onslaught of warnings—which have left even critics pleasantly surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "And spectators could justifiably be nervous that this work could be undermined by gas prices alone—after all, more than half the rise in the August Consumer Price Index was down to petroleum.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Wirth has faith in the U.S. consumer, saying $100 a barrel is higher than “we tend to see in the long term.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think it will have some effect on the economy, but we’ve had relatively higher oil prices now for most of this year and certainly all of last year,” he said. “The recession that everyone’s been talking about hasn’t arrived, and so I think the underlying drivers of the economy in the U.S.—and frankly globally—remain pretty healthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think it’s a drag on the economy but one that thus far the economy’s been able to tolerate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Where can I find the cheapest gas in the U.S.?\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the most expensive states to buy gas are on the West Coast, according to public service site AAA.\n",
      "\n",
      "California has the most expensive gas, with regular petroleum costing an average of $5.793 a gallon. Mid-grade comes in at $5.992 a gallon and premium fuel comes at $6.148 a gallon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following California is Nevada at $5.057 a gallon, Washington at $5.043, Hawaii at $4.836, and Oregon at $4.688.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely drivers on the East Coast—and in the South—enjoy the lowest gas prices. Mississippi ($3.296 per gallon) has the lowest price in the country while Georgia ($3.356 per gallon), Louisiana ($3.395 per gallon), South Carolina ($3.411 per gallon) and Alabama ($3.418 per gallon) round out the bottom five.\n",
      "\n",
      "The price discrepancy comes down to a range of factors, including proximity to refineries, ports, pipeline and blending terminals—and taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "California tends to have the highest and most volatile prices because the state has high fuel taxes as well as a stringent gasoline program that is stricter than the federal government's—and fewer refineries produce the product.\n",

      "\n",
      "A Reuters report states the company was targeted by the Scattered Spider hacker group via the company's identity software, Okta. CBS News reported that hackers similarly targeted Caesars Entertainment, which paid millions of dollars in ransom but still saw a \"significant number\" of loyalty customer data stolen.\n",

      "The company still hasn't responded to TPG's request for comment. It has provided minimal public statements save for a Sept. 12 announcement first acknowledging the cybersecurity issue and that it had notified law enforcement. Two days later, MGM Resorts posted a statement to its X account that the company was continuing to \"work diligently to resolve our cybersecurity issue.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The robot has five built-in camera systems and uses optical coherence tomography for non-invasive imaging of brain tissue. The robot uses a needle as thin as a human hair, which inserts the \"threads exactly where they need to be,\" Neuralink's site says.\n",

      "\n",
      "Several dozen ultra-thin threads protrude from the implant; those go directly into the brain.

      "Author: []\n",
      "Publish Date: None\n",
      "Content: Fed Chair Jerome Powell reaffirmed Wednesday that the central bank is still chasing an elusive soft landing, even as he acknowledged that executing a tightening campaign without triggering a widespread downturn is not the baseline expectation but rather a “plausible outcome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A soft landing is a primary objective,\" Powell said during Wednesday's Fed policy press conference. \"That's what we've been trying to achieve for all this time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A soft landing is generally understood as a successful tightening cycle where the Fed raises rates just enough to slow the economy and cool inflation without slowing it too much to force a recession. Such economic feats are considered improbable. And policymakers and economists have described Powell's aim as taking a narrow and delicate path. So far the Fed has successfully walked that tightrope. But the market recoiled when Powell noted that he did not see the soft landing as the baseline case.\n",
      "\n",
      "US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 20, 2023. The US Federal Reserve voted Wednesday to keep interest rates at a 22-year high while forecasting an additional rate hike before the end of the year to bring down inflation. (Mandel NGAN / AFP via Getty Images)\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ultimately this may be decided by factors that are outside our control,\" he said, adding that \"I wouldn't want to handicap the likelihood of it, though. It's not up to me to do that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For market watchers and the broader public, achieving a soft landing carries enormous importance because it will spell the difference between a recession and economic vitality. But actually pulling one off, as the metaphor implies, is an unlikely endeavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Powell's remarks on the potential of a soft landing highlight the risks of purposefully setting out to hinder the economy for the sake of bringing inflation under control. Any signs that show the economy deviating from a soft landing, or a loss of confidence in one, would trigger further uncertainty and pessimism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept itself does not have a hard definition. And historical studies of past Fed tightening cycles reveal that soft landings require a rare combination of just-so \"Goldilocks\" conditions and a good deal of luck showered on central bankers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Story continues\n",

      "Stocks ended the day in the red following Powell's remarks. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.9% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost 0.22%. Meanwhile the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Powell reiterated that the Fed's ultimate aim is to get price increases under control. \"The worst thing we can do is fail to restore price stability because the record is clear on that. If you don’t restore price stability inflation comes back and you can have a long period where the economy is just very uncertain,\" he said.\n",

      "Author: ['Alexander Tin', 'Cbs News Reporter Covering Public Health', 'The Pandemic.']\n",
      "Publish Date: None\n",
      "Content: The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday did not approve Neffy, an epinephrine nasal spray from drugmaker ARS Pharmaceuticals, keeping the first needle-free option for Americans to treat severe allergic reactions off the market pending more trial data.\n",
      "\n",
      "ARS had expected the FDA to approve Neffy for use in adults and children who weigh more than 30 kilograms, or around 66 pounds. The spray would have required a prescription, similar to EpiPens and other epinephrine injections that are currently used to treat anaphylaxis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Epinephrine is crucial in an emergency to treat potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. The new spray, if eventually approved, would provide a welcome alternative for many families of children with severe allergies who'd rather avoid needles.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to ARS, the FDA regulators decided Tuesday that more data was needed to evaluate the safety of repeated doses of the nasal spray before it could be approved. Some FDA advisers had suggested at a previous meeting in May that additional data would not need to be gathered in a trial after the drug was brought to market, so the drugmaker voiced disappointment over the Tuesday decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are very surprised by this action and the late requirement at this time to change the repeat-dose study from a post-marketing requirement, which we had previously aligned on with FDA, to a pre-approval requirement, particularly given the positive Advisory Committee vote,\" said ARS Pharma co-founder, president and CEO Richard Lowenthal in a statement late Tuesday. \"We are deeply disappointed that this action further delays the availability of neffy for the millions of people who are at risk of a potentially life-threatening severe allergic reaction. Patients and caregivers are waiting for neffy, and we aim to complete the newly requested trial as quickly as possible to meet the needs of patients.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Major barriers limit the rapid use of epinephrine in a community setting. Many patients fear needles and many are not comfortable with self-injection. There is also the impracticality of carrying the current available devices,\" Lowenthal told a panel of the FDA's outside advisers at the meeting in May to weigh the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lowenthal told the committee that the company planned to provide the product in a \"slim Neffy carrying case\" that carries two sprayers each.\n",
      "\n",
      "As many as 85% of patients who face severe allergies would be willing to carry epinephrine around with them daily if Neffy was an option, Lowenthal said their surveys suggested, up from around 55% with current options.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If they don't have it with them, it's a moot point. They don't deliver, they don't have drug, they go to the hospital,\" said Lowenthal in May.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drugmaker says Neffy nasal spray works by delivering a dose of epinephrine to patients facing allergy attacks using two other technologies already used in other FDA-approved products. One is the substance dodecylmaltoside, licensed from drugmaker Neurelis, which it says \"enhances drug absorption\" through mucous membranes, which are cells that line the airways from the nose to the lungs. Neurelis has used this ingredient, branded as Intravail, in a spray of their own to treat epilepsy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other is a sprayer device sold by Aptar Pharma that is already used in a number of products. It's the same type of sprayer used by the Narcan-brand nasal sprays of naloxone, which are used to treat drug overdoses and were recently greenlighted by the FDA for over-the-counter sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the availability of some generic alternatives, some Americans continue to face steep price tags for annual purchases of the currently available epinephrine injection devices. Brand name EpiPen and its generic alternatives can cost some families more than $200 per year, which has led some states to explore caps on epinephrine prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "More epinephrine nasal sprays are also in the pipeline. Drugmaker Bryn Pharma has touted promising results from its experimental epinephrine nasal spray Utuly, which they say could outperform current injectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Questions about effectiveness\n",
      "\n",
      "The FDA's request for more data was just the latest delay for ARS' bid to bring the drug to market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company had previously said the FDA could decide on approval of Neffy by mid-2023. But ARS disclosed in June that the FDA had told the company it would need until September to decide on the approval. The extra time was needed to finish \"labeling and post-marketing commitment discussions\" raised after the FDA advisory committee meeting on Neffy, the company said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A majority of the FDA's Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee ended up voting in May to back the product's benefits outweighing its risks, after wrestling with a number of questions around whether the spray might be less effective than current injections.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Following the strong endorsement of our clinical data for neffy at the May PADAC meeting, there was limited time to address any final questions and complete labeling,\" Lowenthal had said in a release.\n",
      "\n",
      "While epinephrine is widely accepted by experts as effective at treating severe allergic reactions, use of the chemical — purified adrenaline that dates back to the early 20th century — predates the existence of the FDA. That means epinephrine's original use for treating anaphylaxis came about without clinical trials to directly prove that it works, as well as to better understand what measurements of the drug in the body are required for it to be effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original EpiPen was approved in 1987 without clinical trials or detailed data on how the drug is absorbed or its effects on the body, the FDA says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical trials to prove that delivering epinephrine as a spray works as well as an injection would be difficult to run ethically, FDA officials acknowledged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, ARS Pharmaceuticals ran a variety of studies to generate so-called \"surrogate\" data aimed at figuring out whether its spray could likely be as effective as injections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those included dosing subjects exposed to seasonal allergens, as well as measuring concentrations of the drug in their body, which generated some conflicting data. Comparisons with measurements from epinephrine injections also led to varied results.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I really want this product to work. I mean, we definitely benefit from a needle-less means of delivering epi. And I think the sponsor has done a nice job trying to find that balance. That said, I think we're using weak surrogate data to assure ourselves,\" Lewis Nelson, a member of the FDA committee, said at the May meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nelson echoed other committee members in praising the company and FDA's approach to solving some of the substantial variabilities seen with other epinephrine injections. But he also said he thought more data would be needed in order to approve the drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I really would hate to learn, without some better clinical data, that we recommend approval of a product on the basis of surrogate data that's inconsistent and somewhat confusing and, ultimately because of that, patients are harmed,\" he said at the meeting.\n",

      "“It’s surprising that the Canadian union was able to reach an agreement with Ford but for whatever reason, the UAW was not able to reach an agreement with that same company, as well as General Motors and Chrysler (Stellantis). What that means to me is perhaps the three companies aren’t being entirely unreasonable in the bargaining process,” Douglas said.\n",

      "\"Unless General Motors, Ford and Chrysler are asking its membership to start paying out of pocket for health care — which I don't think is the case — that shouldn't be an issue with bargaining between the three companies and the UAW in the U.S.,\" he said.\n",

      "Content: Hyundai Motor Group is pushing the accelerator pedal when it comes to its newest North American factory. The company broke ground on the multibillion-dollar site in Bryan County, Georgia, last October with the aim of beginning production of electric vehicles in 2025. But on Tuesday, Hyundai president and CEO Jose Munoz revealed that timeline has been brought forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We try to accelerate as much as possible, the project. And we are confident that the original date of January 2025 would be probably pulled ahead maybe three months or so. If we can, even more,\" Munoz said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main motivation for building EVs locally in the US is the new clean vehicle tax incentives. Created as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, these came into effect at the beginning of this year and address criticisms of the previous EV tax credit by adding income and price caps, allowing dealers to claim the credit if they immediately apply it to the price of the car and creating a tax credit for buying a used EV.\n",

The HMG Metaplant America will build EVs like the Ioniq 6 at a cost of $7.6 billion—Hyundai says it will create more than 8,500 jobs in Bryan County in the process. Another $5 billion is being invested in a joint-venture battery factory with SK On in Bartow County on the far side of the state.

      "\n",
      "The original lawsuit, filed in June, claimed that Amazon had tricked millions into unwittingly subscribing to Prime through buttons that were presented prominently during checkout. The FTC added new details to back up its claims on Wednesday, including internal messages and the names of three senior Amazon leaders who allegedly “played a key role” in the scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "The executives include two of Amazon’s most senior leaders at the time, Neil Lindsay — the senior vice president who oversaw Prime — and Russell Grandinetti, Amazon’s senior vice president of international consumer. The FTC also named Jamil Ghani, an Amazon vice president who oversaw the Prime subscription program.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amended complaint accuses Amazon of using deceptive tactics to create an enrollment process for Prime that was easy for customers to accidentally trigger. Amazon employees, per the FTC, began expressing concerns to company leadership about these strategies in 2016, but those executives didn’t take action.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, Amazon designers once asked Lindsay about the company’s use of dark patterns — elements of Amazon’s user interface that allegedly aim to trick customers into subscribing to Prime. Lindsay, the lawsuit claims, said that Amazon was “okay” with their use. His explanation was that “once consumers become Prime members — even unknowingly — they will see what a great program it is and remain members.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The amended complaint also includes new internal messages and emails indicating that Amazon and its leaders were aware of their deception. One company newsletter reads, “The issue of accidental Prime-sign ups is well documented” while admitting that Prime customers “sign[] up accidentally and/or [don’t] see auto-renewal terms.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Once customers were signed up, the FTC argues, Amazon also created an intentionally complicated cancellation process. The process was codenamed “Iliad,” referring to Homer’s ancient epic poem.\n",

      "Lindsay, the complaint adds, has internally floated the idea of making the Prime cancellation process as easy as the Prime enrollment process but has stated that he finds the idea “scary.”\n",

      "Content: Fresh allegations of potential securities fraud have been leveled at Elon Musk over statements he recently made regarding the deaths of primates used for research at Neuralink, his biotech startup. Letters sent this afternoon to top officials at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by a medical ethics group call on the agency to investigate Musk’s claims that monkeys who died during trials at the company were terminally ill and did not die as a result of Neuralink implants. They claim, based on veterinary records, that complications with the implant procedures led to their deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk first acknowledged the deaths of the macaques on September 10 in a reply to a user on his social networking app X (formerly Twitter). He denied that any of the deaths were “a result of a Neuralink implant” and said the researchers had taken care to select subjects who were already “close to death.” Relatedly, in a presentation last fall Musk claimed that Neuralink’s animal testing was never “exploratory,” but was instead conducted to confirm fully formed scientific hypotheses. “We are extremely careful,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Public records reviewed by WIRED, and interviews conducted with a former Neuralink employee and a current researcher at the University of California, Davis primate center, paint a wholly different picture of Neuralink’s animal research. The documents include veterinary records, first made public last year, that contain gruesome portrayals of suffering reportedly endured by as many as a dozen of Neuralink’s primate subjects, all of whom needed to be euthanized. These records could serve as the basis for any potential SEC probe into Musk’s comments about Neuralink, which has faced multiple federal investigations as the company moves toward its goal of releasing the first commercially available brain-computer interface for humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "The letters to the SEC come from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a nonprofit striving to abolish live animal testing. The group claims that Musk’s comments about the primate deaths were misleading, that he knew them “to be false,” and that investors deserve to hear the truth about the safety, “and thus the marketability,” of Neuralink’s speculative product.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are claiming they are going to put a safe device on the market, and that’s why you should invest,” Ryan Merkley, who leads the Physicians Committee’s research into animal-testing alternatives, tells WIRED. “And we see his lie as a way to whitewash what happened in these exploratory studies.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Musk’s post on X about Neuralink’s monkeys has been viewed more than 760,000 times, and the Physicians Committee notes in its letters that when the SEC charged Musk with securities fraud related to Tesla in 2018, the agency argued that his account was a source of investor news. The SEC has jurisdiction over the sale of any securities, including those offered by privately held companies such as Neuralink. Recent filings show the company has raised more than $280 million from outside investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SEC declined WIRED’s request to comment on the Physicians Committee’s letters. Neuralink did not respond to specific questions about Musk’s claims or a request for comment about the Physicians Committee’s allegations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a year of its reported founding in March 2017, Neuralink acquired a large number of animal subjects to test its brain-chip implants. From September 2017 until late 2020, the company’s experiments were aided by the staff of the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), a federally funded bioresearch facility at UC Davis. Musk’s promise was to revolutionize prostheses and engineer an implant that would allow human brains to communicate wirelessly with artificial devices, and even each other.\n",

      "Intel is already starting to adopt one key element of Apple Silicon chips in this year’s Meteor Lake chips, which will ship just in time for the last Windows PCs of the year. Namely, packaging: combining related chips into a single unit alongside the main CPU for greater efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meteor Lake chips combine CPU, GPU, and connectivity in this way, with Intel admitting that the packaging tech is now as important as the size of the chip process used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intel is also adopting Apple’s performance and efficiency core approach.\n",

      "\n",
      "Will match Apple’s performance next year\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Gelsinger claims that Intel will have caught up with Apple Silicon by next year. While CNET’s headline says Intel is claiming it will outclass Apple, the chief exec’s actual quote is somewhat more restrained.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the processor progression from Meteor Lake through Panther Lake, Intel compares its performance to rivals including Apple on three speed tests: CPUs (central processing units for general computing), GPUs (graphics processing units) and NPUs (neural processing units to speed up AI) within a fixed power budget. “We look at the aggregate capability that we’re delivering between those three, and we think these platforms get very competitive, the best that Mac or anybody else offers,” Gelsinger said in a press conference at the show. “We’re feeling very, very good about the road map.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Expects to overtake TSMC in one tech\n",
      "\n",
      "Intel does claim that it will overtake Apple’s TSMC-made chips in one respect. While it has fallen behind in the race toward ever smaller processes using extreme ultraviolet light (EUV) etching, the next generation of this tech is known as high numeric aperture (high NA) EUV.\n",
      "\n",
      "CNET’s report says that, compared to TSMC, Intel “expects to be ahead, at least a little bit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, high NA EUV can’t yet produce the size of chips needed to compete with existing processors, so it would rely on advanced packaging techniques to combine smaller ones. Whether this will prove competitive with Apple Silicon remains to be seen.\n",

      "In addition to those challenging conditions, homebuyers now also have to contend with rising home prices in some markets. This pushed the average loan size on a purchase application to $416,800, the highest level in six weeks, according to the report.\n",

      "The increase in total mortgage applications was driven higher by a surprise increase in applications to refinance a mortgage. Refinance applications climbed 13% from the previous week, but were still almost 30% below the same week one year ago.\n",

      "Content: Deeper Into the Numbers: Core inflation slowed faster than expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The volatility and international nature of energy prices mean policymakers are also closely watching other measures of inflation to determine how embedded price growth has become in the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key gauge of domestic price pressures is core inflation, which strips out energy and food costs. Last month, the annual rate of core inflation fell to 6.2 percent, from 6.9 percent in July, a faster decline than economists had predicted. It was driven by a slowdown in services inflation, another key measure because it reflects companies’ labor costs — wages tend to be a persistent force of inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why It Matters: The government pledged to halve inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As household budgets have been squeezed by high energy bills, grocery prices and other costs, Wednesday’s data will bring some confidence that inflation is abating. The headline rate of inflation has slowed meaningfully from its peak in October, when it climbed above 11 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, pledged to halve inflation this year, a goal he is on track to meet. But price growth is still uncomfortably fast, and the government has remained cautious. On Wednesday, Jeremy Hunt, Britain’s top finance official, said the government would “stick to our plan” to halve inflation “so we can ease the pressure on families and businesses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "How Britain Compares: Higher energy prices reignite inflation pressures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as progress has been made in reducing price pressures in many countries, central bankers have been wary of declaring victory too soon as inflation rates are still above their targets. Rising energy prices pushed up inflation in the United States last month and added to inflation pressures in other European countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the headline rate of inflation in Britain is still much higher than in the United States, where prices rose 3.7 percent in August, and the eurozone, where price growth averaged 5.2 percent for the 20 countries that use the euro.\n",
      "\n",
      "While some differences can be explained by how these countries respond to changes in wholesale energy prices, there are other signs that inflation is more persistent in Britain. Core inflation is also higher in Britain, as it faces faster-than-expected wage growth in the private sector because of a tight labor market.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s Next: Britain’s central bank will set interest rates on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bank of England has raised interest rates to the highest level in 15 years in an effort to stamp out high inflation. Policymakers are trying to find a balance between tightening policy enough to return inflation to the central bank’s 2 percent target without pushing the economy into a recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest decision on interest rates will be announced on Thursday. For months, members of the rate-setting committee have been divided over whether to take more action to bring down inflation or if they were at risk of overdoing it and causing unnecessary damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Policymakers voting to increase rates have been in the majority, so far. But amid signs that inflation is slowing and the British economy is weak, there have been growing bets among investors that the central bank might hold off on raising interest rates this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wednesday’s inflation data was lower than the central bank forecast last month, a positive surprise that is likely to increase expectations that the bank will pause this week.\n",

      "How High Will CD Rates Go This Year?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fed has been aggressively combating decades-high inflation since March of last year, with fast-and-furious 2022 hikes to the federal funds rate, and easing to more moderate increases in 2023. On July 26, the Fed bumped rates for the 11th time in 12 meetings, taking the cumulative increase to 5.25%.\n",
      "\n",
      "That raises the central bank's benchmark rate to its highest level since 2001. In turn, it's created record rate conditions for CD shoppers, as well as for anyone holding cash in a high-yield savings or money market account.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fed is convened today and will conclude its meeting with a rate announcement tomorrow at 2 p.m. Eastern. Traders have priced in a 99% probability that the Fed will hold rates stable, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the chance of the Fed hiking rates at its November or December meeting is notably higher, currently standing at 25-40% odds. That's due to inflation still remaining stubborn, as reported in the latest inflation data released last week. For a second month in a row, inflation rose month-over-month. And while the Fed's preferred measure of \"core\" inflation, which excludes volatile gas and food prices, did not rise as much, it was still slightly higher than economist forecasts. This could lead the Fed to implement a 12th rate hike in November or December.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an Aug. 25 speech, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said further rate increases were on the table if inflation doesn't come down enough in the coming months. Other Fed Board members have since echoed the sentiment that future rate hikes are still a possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though this week's meeting will almost certainly not conclude with a new rate hike, it will involve a fresh release of projections on whether Fed board members believe another increase will be needed. It will also likely provide clues on how long Fed committee members expect they'll need to hold the benchmark rate at its 22-year high.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Fed does implement another increase later this year, it would certainly nudge CD rates a bit higher than their already record levels. But September's expected hold will leave markets—and CD shoppers—guessing if the pause is temporary or permanent. Once the end of the Fed's campaign is more confidently in sight, that will finally signal CD rates have reached a peak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that the \"top rates\" quoted here are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research on hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is much different than the national average, which includes all banks offering a CD with that term, including many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, the national averages are always quite low, while the top rates you can unearth by shopping around are often five, 10, or even 15 times higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rate Collection Methodology Disclosure\n",
      "\n",
      "Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Banks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

      "Content: The Walt Disney Co. hosted Wall Street representatives at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando early this week for the Hollywood conglomerate’s 2023 investor summit focused on the Disney Parks, Experiences and Products (DPEP) unit, led by its theme parks.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a time when much debate has centered on Disney’s future ownership and plans for streamer Hulu, along with the potential sale of ABC and linear TV assets, the investor gathering explored such topics as the DPEP segment’s post-COVID pandemic growth and profitability outlook, visitor and spending trends, new theme park attractions and investment in the firm’s cruise ships business. Disney also touted a major expansion of its DPEP business, with a vow to invest $60 billion over the next 10 years to turbocharge growth in the lucrative unit, nearly doubling its spending over the prior 10-year period.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a big investment, but it’s also already a big business,” TD Cowen analyst Doug Creutz summarized his takeaways on the initiative in a report. He has a “market perform” rating and $94 price target on Disney’s stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Disney management expressed a strong belief that DPEP can continue to be a major growth driver for Disney in the future,” the expert wrote. “Their optimism is reasonably based on (1) high historical return on investments (ROIs) for the segment, (2) a (somewhat surprising to us) amount of still undeveloped land at their existing parks, and (3) opportunities to meaningfully expand their cruise and vacation club ‘Signature Experiences.'”\n",

      "Creutz estimated that the planned investment “could drive mid- to high-single-digit percentage annual earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) growth at DPEP over the next 10 years, assuming future ROIs are comparable to levels seen over the past 10-15 years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He also highlighted upcoming DPEP projects, including the planned opening of the “World of Frozen” at Disney’s Hong Kong theme park in November; “Zootopia Land” in Shanghai, also later this year; “Fantasy Springs” in Tokyo in 2024, funded by Tokyo partner Oriental Land Company; a “Frozen Land” at the Paris park, for which a launch date is yet to be decided; three new cruise ships launching 2024-2026; a new private island cruise port in the Bahamas launching in 2024; and “1,000 new Vacation Club ‘keys’ opening over the next five years,” which Creutz noted means a 15 percent capacity expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beyond the projects delineated above, management expects to be flexible in allocating resources, targeting capital expenditures to projects that offer the highest expected returns,” the TD Cowen analyst noted about the financial impact. “Management indicated that the ramp in capital expenditures would be moderate over the next few years (versus our estimate of $3 billion DPEP capital expenditures in fiscal year 2023), but rising over time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich gave her report the title “Investing in the Magic,” analyzing Disney CEO Bob Iger’s work this way: “After spending the past 11 months restructuring Disney and re-evaluating its asset mix, we believe his four key priorities include: 1) direct-to-consumer (DTC) — and driving an improvement in profitability, 2) managing the transition in linear while recognizing the disruption in the business, 3) revitalizing the creative engine that is at the heart of the Disney brand and 4) turbocharging growth in theme parks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She doesn’t see the magic having an impact overnight, though. “We expect progress on these priorities could take several quarters, if not years, to materialize (e.g. improving film is a longer-term endeavor) but given Bob Iger’s track record and stature in the media industry, we continue to believe his steady leadership bodes well for the future performance of Disney.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While reiterating her “buy” rating on Disney shares, Reif Ehrlich lowered her price target by $25 to $110, noting that this was “in line with Disney’s historical premium to the S&P500 and reflects the transition underway for Disney and the media industry more broadly.” As near-term catalysts, she identified “additional updates on the strategic outlook for Disney and continued robust theme park demand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of theme parks, the Bank of America expert’s takeaways from Disney’s DPEP investor event were as follows: “The recovery in Disney theme parks post-COVID has been astounding as both revenue and operating income are well ahead of pre-pandemic levels. However, the recent bounceback spotlights what had already been strong financial performance in theme parks over the past decade. … However, there appears to be ample runway to continue to invest and grow the business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One data point Reif Ehrlich highlighted: “There is still a 700 million addressable market (as identified by income and Disney affinity), so for every one park guest there are 10-plus consumers with a Disney affinity who do not visit the parks. As a result, Disney will lean into this opportunity and invest $60 billion into theme parks and experiences over the next decade, funded by existing free cash flow.” The analyst predicted a financial payoff, writing: “Given the return profile of these businesses, we believe the increased investments are prudent to drive sustained longer-term growth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall, who has an “overweight” rating and $110 stock price target on Disney, making it a “signature pick” for his firm, wrote that he also liked what he heard. “Disney’s investor summit showed the company’s bullishness on parks/cruises, which remain among the best and most unique assets in media,” he highlighted in his report. “However, Disney is a complex story, and we think direct-to-consumer profitability remains the real key to unlocking future value.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The expert also pointed out that investors had hoped for more guidance. “While Disney is bullish on the parks opportunity, investors left the event a bit frustrated on what it all means for returns,” Cahall suggested. “The spending guidance is out there, but it’s unclear if parks earnings growth should accelerate alongside spending growth. If earnings stay unchanged, then higher capex = lower Street free cash flow.” That said, the analyst also noted that management “did indicate confidence that parks will generate ‘strong free cash flow,’ the capital expenditure build is slow/discretionary, and the balance sheet is healthy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But his bullishness on Disney is all about streaming and content. “We still believe the real reason to own Disney here is that content is under-monetized on direct-to-consumer (DTC) given the valuable library and relatively low average revenue per user on Disney+ and Hulu,” Cahall wrote. “We think DTC will be profitable earlier and more strongly than consensus. Bob Iger discussed a renewed focus on IP improvement, which underlies the terminal value of Disney reflected in parks and DTC — the vast majority of the stock’s value.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne has an “overweight” rating and $105 stock price target on Disney, meaning upside potential of about 30 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Discussing the DPEP investor summit in a report, he addressed the $60 billion capital spending plan over the next decade. “This is expected to be self-funded by the parks business and aimed at both expanding capacity at its parks and resorts globally and investing in technology to help improve returns,” Swinburne emphasized. “The capital expenditure will likely scale up gradually over time, leaving no material impact to free cash flow expectations in ’23 and ’24. For perspective, after layering in this higher capital spending outlook, we forecast DPEP capital intensity of 13-15 percent over the next decade, similar to the prior decade (excluding the pandemic years).”\n",
      "\n",
      "Noting that “the Parks & Experiences businesses account for 75 percent of fiscal year 2023 segment operating income at Disney,” he called them “uniquely attractive in long-term growth potential, scale, and returns, warranting a low double-digit earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple.” Added Swinburne: “By implication, at current Disney share prices, Disney’s media (DMED) assets in aggregate are valued at roughly $50 billion, less than one time sales, or 30 percent of Netflix’s current enterprise value.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Morgan Stanley expert concluded by highlighting that his $105 Disney stock price target means “a premium to media peers due to its parks business and media monetization growth opportunity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris had already written a Sept. 15 investor event preview report, titled: “Cruisin’ the Parks: Digging into Domestic, International, and New Attraction Details.” “Recent data suggests slower activity and continued challenging comparisons domestically and sequentially slower park app downloads internationally,” he mentioned. “We expect positive commentary on longer-term trends supported by cruise investment, possible domestic footprint expansion, and new international attractions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In his discussion of the entertainment giant’s cruise ship business, Morris noted that Disney plans to launch two additional cruise ships in its fiscal year 2025, with a third new ship set to debut in fiscal year 2026. “With a full year of operation in fiscal year 2023, we estimate that cruise lines will comprise about 6.6 percent of total parks revenue, growing to 8.0 percent contribution in fiscal year 2025 ($2.6 billion of $32.5 billion total) and around 9.4 percent in fiscal year 2026 ($3.3 billion),” he forecast.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his post-event report on Wednesday, Morris summarized key takeaways from management commentary and maintained his “buy” rating and $125 stock price target on Disney. “CEO Bob Iger highlighted a strategic shift from structure repair to growth,” he highlighted. “There are 1,000 acres of available land across all Disney physical properties — equivalent to seven Disneyland parks,” with only 30 percent of Walt Disney World land currently developed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Leadership also highlighted more optimally distributed attendance post-COVID as a tool for better managing costs,” the Guggenheim analyst noted, mentioning that management spoke about the opportunity to increase Disneyland California theme park capacity by 50 percent, among other things. “Management will adjust attendance caps to increase parks monetization opportunity.” For example, capacity caps increased 20 percent in the past two years at Walt Disney World, he cited a data point shared by Disney’s management team.\n",

      "Author: ['Andrew Hutchinson', 'Content', 'Social Media Manager']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2023-09-20 03:20:00\n",
      "Content: After originally announcing its Meta Verified program for creators back in February, Meta is now set to expand the program even further, with a new Meta Verified for Business package coming soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "As announced by the Meta team at their Conversations conference in Mumbai, Meta Verified for businesses will provide another way for brands to add more authority to their account, by buying a verified checkmark, even if the process of selling checkmarks lessens the value of the marker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is the same criticism we’ve had of X’s ‘X Premium’ offering, that in selling checkmarks, you’re eroding any perceived reputational value that they may provide. But clearly, both X and Meta are generating enough interest in their paid verification packages to keep expanding them, with Meta also looking to sell business verification at a slightly higher price point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current Meta Verified package for individual creators costs $US11.99 per month, per platform, when purchased on the web, or $US14.99 when you subscribe within the app. Meta’s verification for business package will cost $US21.99 per month per Instagram account or Facebook Page when purchased on the website, or $US27.99 for each via mobile sign-up. And interestingly, Meta’s also looking to offer a combination package this time around, priced at $US34.99 for verification of both your Facebook and IG business pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, there’s no such package deal for individual creators, you have to pay for both separately to get checkmarks in each app. Which means you’re looking at $US24.98 per month, at a minimum, for both.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for businesses, it costs slightly more, though it’s a lot less than X’s $US1,000 per month Verification for Organizations package, and it also offers much the same elements, including this interesting variable in the bottom right:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get discovered in new ways by being featured as a Meta Verified business”\n",
      "\n",
      "That could be interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the initial Meta Verified package for creators, Meta had included an offer of “increased reach” for verified accounts, but then it quickly removed it after early testing. Meta hasn’t explained why it got rid of this element (note: X Premium gives subscribers additional exposure benefits), but this new addition for businesses sounds somewhat similar, though there’s no further detail as to exactly what it means as yet, and how verified businesses will get this additional exposure in each app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe Meta will add new Meta Verified showcase panels in the main feed, or it’ll provide special signifiers in its discovery elements. Whatever it is, it could be a valuable lure for brands, who are no going to be interested in this offering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because any added credibility will no doubt help, though again, the more businesses and creators that sign-up, the less valuable the checkmark will become, as users come to understand that anyone, and any business, can just buy a blue tick, and it doesn’t actually signify credibility or trust like it once did.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it’ll get Meta a few bucks, and after running the program for the better part of a year, it’s obviously okay with any potential negatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though hopefully, Meta’s also expanding its support staff in step. A report this week from The Information suggests that many people who’ve paid for Meta’s Verified package thus far have been less than satisfied with the direct support offering, with access to human assistance becoming more limited over time, as more users sign up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presumably, Meta’s aware of this, as the human support element is a key lure for many, and it’s going to get even more stretched as brands sign on as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meta also notes that existing verified badge holders won’t be impacted by this expansion, unlike X, which has removed the badges for all non-paying users. WhatsApp verification will also, eventually, be included in the offering.\n",
      "\n",
      "As noted, selling verification checks seems like a flawed strategy, in that it effectively reduces its own value over time, but there has always been demand for these in-app markers, and as a means to drive some easy additional revenue, I can see why both X and Meta are going with it. But it still seems like a road to nowhere, which, over time, will lose value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or Elon Musk is right, and eventually, we’ll all be paying to subscribe to social apps, and this is just the beginning of that next push. I guess, really, it depends on take-up, and if we reach a tipping point, where more businesses are verified than those that aren’t, maybe then it’ll become a more critical offering for all brands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or it could go the other way, as it has on X thus far, and fewer businesses bother to sign on, because it doesn’t actually mean anything. Then you have to look at other motivators to boost interest, which is why X is reportedly considering charging all users instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever it may be, it seems like we’re going to find out, as Meta’s Verified for Business package is coming sometime soon.\n",

      "Author: []\n",
      "Publish Date: None\n",
      "Content: WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued guidance about certain legal requirements that lenders must adhere to when using artificial intelligence and other complex models. The guidance describes how lenders must use specific and accurate reasons when taking adverse actions against consumers. This means that creditors cannot simply use CFPB sample adverse action forms and checklists if they do not reflect the actual reason for the denial of credit or a change of credit conditions. This requirement is especially important with the growth of advanced algorithms and personal consumer data in credit underwriting. Explaining the reasons for adverse actions help improve consumers’ chances for future credit, and protect consumers from illegal discrimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Technology marketed as artificial intelligence is expanding the data used for lending decisions, and also growing the list of potential reasons for why credit is denied,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “Creditors must be able to specifically explain their reasons for denial. There is no special exemption for artificial intelligence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In today’s marketplace, creditors are increasingly using complex algorithms, marketed as artificial intelligence, and other predictive decision-making technologies in their underwriting models. Creditors often feed these complex algorithms with large datasets, sometimes including data that may be harvested from consumer surveillance. As a result, a consumer may be denied credit for reasons they may not consider particularly relevant to their finances. Despite the potentially expansive list of reasons for adverse credit actions, some creditors may inappropriately rely on a checklist of reasons provided in CFPB sample forms. However, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act does not allow creditors to simply conduct check-the-box exercises when delivering notices of adverse action if doing so fails to accurately inform consumers why adverse actions were taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the CFPB confirmed in a circular from last year that the Equal Credit Opportunity Act requires creditors to explain the specific reasons for taking adverse actions. This requirement remains even if those companies use complex algorithms and black-box credit models that make it difficult to identify those reasons. Today’s guidance expands on last year’s circular by explaining that sample adverse action checklists should not be considered exhaustive, nor do they automatically cover a creditor’s legal requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, today’s guidance explains that even for adverse decisions made by complex algorithms, creditors must provide accurate and specific reasons. Generally, creditors cannot state the reasons for adverse actions by pointing to a broad bucket. For instance, if a creditor decides to lower the limit on a consumer’s credit line based on behavioral spending data, the explanation would likely need to provide more details about the specific negative behaviors that led to the reduction beyond a general reason like “purchasing history.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Creditors that simply select the closest factors from the checklist of sample reasons are not in compliance with the law if those reasons do not sufficiently reflect the actual reason for the action taken. Creditors must disclose the specific reasons, even if consumers may be surprised, upset, or angered to learn their credit applications were being graded on data that may not intuitively relate to their finances.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to today’s and last year’s circulars, the CFPB has issued an advisory opinion that consumer financial protection law requires lenders to provide adverse action notices to borrowers when changes are made to their existing credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CFPB has made the intersection of fair lending and technology a priority. For instance, as the demand for digital, algorithmic scoring of prospective tenants has increased among corporate landlords, the CFPB reminded landlords that prospective tenants must receive adverse action notices when denied housing. The CFPB also has joined with other federal agencies to issue a proposed rule on automated valuation models, and is actively working to ensure that black-box models do not lead to acts of digital redlining in the mortgage market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read Consumer Financial Protection Circular 2023-03, Adverse action notification requirements and the proper use of the CFPB’s sample forms provided in Regulation B.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumers can submit complaints about financial products and services by visiting the CFPB’s website or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372).\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees who believe their companies have violated federal consumer financial protection laws are encouraged to send information about what they know to whistleblower@cfpb.gov. Workers in technical fields, including those that design, develop, and implement artificial intelligence, may also report potential misconduct to the CFPB.

      "\n",
      "The router would serve to further meet growing demands for fast and reliable broadband wireless connectivity, offering a particular boost that makes the most out multi-gigabit connections.

      "Spectrum Advanced Wi-Fi will cost $5 a month or you can get a 12-month free trial with Spectrum One.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 6 GHz band would create more airwave space for companies wanting to sell wireless home internet. This means less competition among signals and faster, more reliable internet connectivity for users. The new 6 GHz band offers four times the total space available with the available 2.4 and 5Ghz bands. Wi-Fi officials hope that even after 6 GHz routers become more common, the sheer amount of space will keep signals fast and strong.

      "Bank of America is one of several banks who've increased wages over the past few years. In 2022, Truist Financial increased their minimum wage to $22 an hour. And JPMorgan Chase, told employees last year that its minimum wage would increase to between $20 and $25 an hour, depending on location.

      "Content: Edward Tilly, shown in 2017, stepped down as chairman and CEO of the trading exchange Cboe. (Nancy Stone/Chicago Tribune)\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward Tilly, the chairman and CEO of Chicago trading exchange Cboe, resigned Monday after an investigation into his alleged undisclosed personal relationships with colleagues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The announcement Tuesday marks the abrupt end of a long run at the Cboe for Tilly, 60, who rose through the ranks to helm the options exchange in 2013. Tilly is the latest CEO to be toppled by allegations of an inappropriate personal relationship at work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cboe has named board member Fredric Tomczyk, 68, the former president and CEO of TD Ameritrade, to replace Tilly effective immediately, the company said in a news release.\n",
      "\n",
      "In late August, the board and outside counsel launched the investigation, which determined Tilly “did not disclose personal relationships with colleagues” in violation of company policies, the company said. Tilly agreed to resign from the company “without good reason,” receiving his prorated salary and benefits through the termination date but forfeiting all unvested equity incentives, according to a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "William Farrow, a Cboe board member, was named to replace Tilly as non-executive chairman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cboe strives to uphold the highest ethical standards across the organization, and fully investigates and takes appropriate action when it determines that any of its policies have been violated,” Farrow said in the news release. “Fred’s familiarity with Cboe’s business, combined with his multi-decade experience in the financial services industry, will provide stability and reinforce the company’s commitment to growth for Cboe, its associates, customers, index partners, and investors during this period of transition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A Cboe spokesperson declined to comment on the details of the investigation Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The signed resignation letter includes Tilly’s agreement to refrain from making statements to a third party regarding the investigation, resignation or agreement with the Cboe. Efforts to reach Tilly for comment Tuesday were unsuccessful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tilly, who started on the trading floor of the Cboe in 1987, was named CEO in 2013, succeeding the exchange’s longtime leader, William Brodsky. In late 2016, Brodsky stepped down as chairman, with Tilly filling that role as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of his February 2023 employment agreement, Tilly was due to receive an annual base salary of nearly $1.27 million, with a target bonus of about $2.1 million in cash and $6.65 million in equity incentive compensation this year. Tilly will receive a prorated salary and equity incentives through his resignation date, but will forfeit millions in unvested equity incentives, according to SEC filings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tomczyk retired from TD Ameritrade in 2016 after eight years as president and CEO. Previously, he was president and CEO of Canadian insurance company London Life. He joined the Cboe board in 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "As CEO of Cboe, Tomczyk will receive an annual base salary of $1 million, with a target bonus of $1.65 million, both of which will be prorated for 2023. He will also receive an equity incentive award of $7.15 million vesting in three annual installments. The equity incentive is contingent upon Tomczyk serving as CEO for at least one year, and his continued service on the board thereafter, according to the employment agreement.\n",

      "Launched as the Chicago Board Options Exchange in 1973, the CBOE spun off as a publicly traded company in 2010, growing into one of the world’s largest options exchanges and a staple of securities traders worldwide. Its signature products include the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, which measures the expected movement of the broader stock market.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cboe’s incredible success over the past 50 years is a testament to the hard work of each and every associate,” Tomczyk said in the news release. “I have the utmost confidence in the team, and I am excited to work together as we continue to build trusted markets around the globe.”\n",

      "NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday said DoorDash (DASH.N), Grubhub (TKWY.AS) and Uber Eats (UBER.N) can sue New York City over a law capping how much they can charge restaurants for delivering meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods in Manhattan said the plaintiffs adequately alleged that the law violates the U.S. Constitution and New York state constitution by depriving them of their right to contract with restaurants, and forcing them to operate in the city at a loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also said the companies plausibly alleged that the city's \"not-so-veiled\" purpose in capping commissions at 15% for food orders and 5% for advertising and other services was \"economic protectionism for local 'mom and pop' stores and antagonism toward out-of-state, wealthy third-party platforms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The city had said the law's main purpose was to prevent \"social and economic devastation\" that could result if excessive commissions forced restaurant owners to slash employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nicholas Paolucci, a spokesman for New York City's law department, said: \"The city looks forward to making its case in court.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs, which also include Caviar, Seamless and Postmates, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grubhub welcomed the decision, and called on the City Council to give restaurant owners more flexibility to choose which services they want and how much to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Based on the strength of the industry’s case, we continue to urge the City Council to act now and resolve this issue,\" a Grubhub spokesperson said in a mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good news from New York City,\" CEO of Grubhub's parent company Just Eat Takeaway, Jitse Groen, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shares in Just Eat Takeaway were up over 7% in Amsterdam at 1123 GMT.\n",
      "\n",
      "The city adopted the caps in May 2020 as a temporary response to the COVID-19 pandemic, shoring up a restaurant industry beset by closures and upset with paying fees as high as 30%.\n",
      "\n",
      "It made the caps permanent in August 2021, and the lawsuit seeking to overturn them was filed the next month. The lawsuit also seeks damages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Woods said the plaintiffs adequately alleged that the law unconstitutionally interfered with their ability to collect higher commissions under their contracts with restaurants.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also said they could try to prove that the law amounted to an illegal taking, by depriving them of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, and punished them because they were based out of state, violating the \"dormant\" Commerce Clause.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plaintiffs have said commission caps would necessitate higher delivery fees, resulting in higher prices for consumers and less revenue for restaurants.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time of the lawsuit, San Francisco has also enacted permanent commission caps.\n",

      "Author: ['Will Is A National Political Reporter Based In Washington.']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2023-09-13 04:01:25\n",
      "Content: LANSING, Mich. (AP) — The prospect of an auto workers strike could test Joe Biden’s treasured assertion that he’s the most pro-union president in U.S. history.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Auto Workers is threatening to strike against the nation’s big three automakers, General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, if tentative contact agreements aren’t reached by 11:59 p.m. on Thursday. That could reshape the political landscape in the battleground state of Michigan and potentially unleash economic shockwaves nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The auto industry accounts for about 3% of the nation’s gross domestic product and as many as 146,000 workers may walk off their jobs. While the effects would be most immediate in Michigan and other states with high concentrations of auto jobs, such as Ohio and Indiana, a prolonged strike could trigger car shortages and layoffs in auto-supply industries and other sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anything that goes beyond a week, you’re going to start feeling the pain,” said Marick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit. “And anything beyond two weeks, that’s when the effects start to compound.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Doc Killian, who has worked in a Ford assembly plant in Wayne, Michigan, for 26 years, says he can no longer afford the cars he helps build, crystallizing how the nation’s middle class has been squeezed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think the American public as a whole realizes the impact that the American auto workers have on the economy,” Killian said. “If we suffer, the American economy suffers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Biden has built his political career around just such an argument, repeating the mantra that the “middle class built America, and that unions built the middle class.” His administration also has championed organized labor and promoted worker organization unabashedly, with Biden frequently proclaiming himself “the most pro-union president in American history.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Shawn Fain, who was elected president of the United Auto Workers in March after promising a more confrontational stance in negotiating with automakers, countered Biden’s claim on CNN this week, saying, “I think there’s a lot of work to be done in that category.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The UAW chief has also sought to broaden his argument beyond just auto workers. He said on a livestream with union members that the UAW’s demands are about “raising the standard for workers everywhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I truly believe that all of America will stand with us in this fight,” Fain said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biden also must contend with blunt criticism from former President Donald Trump, the early leader in next year’s Republican presidential primary, who is now pushing for the UAW to endorse him — an unlikely prospect, according to union leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump posted online that the “once fabled” UAW “will soon go OUT OF BUSINESS” if Biden “is allowed to pull off his ALL ELECTRIC CAR HOAX. China will build them all. ENDORSE TRUMP!” In another post, the former president appealed directly to rank-and-file union members whose support helped him win Michigan in 2016: “Union leadership must decide whether they will stand with Biden and other far-left political cronies in Washington, or whether they will stand with front-line autoworkers and President Trump.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That referenced new federal rules pushed by the Biden administration requiring two-thirds of new passenger cars sold in the United States to be all-electric by 2032. Trump argued those moves would “murder the U.S. auto industry and kill countless union autoworker jobs forever, especially in Michigan and the Midwest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But some union leaders and members have scoffed at suggestions that the U.S. not embrace efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions since manufacturers in China and elsewhere could rush in to produce electric vehicles if the U.S. doesn’t. Fain, who has previously applauded the “transition to a clean auto industry” as long as autoworkers “have a place in the new economy,” said Trump was “not someone who stands for a good standard of living.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave Green, a UAW regional director in Ohio and Indiana, said the former president “carries no credibility in my book” since “he did nothing to support organized labor except lip service.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Green said he still considers Biden the most pro-union president of his lifetime. But he hopes the White House won’t stay neutral if there’s a strike.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t forget,” Green said. “When you’re in distress, the people who are there supporting you — that goes a long way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Biden faced some criticism from labor groups last year when he urged Congress to approve legislation preventing rail workers from going on strike, fearing an upending of supply chains heading into the holidays. But, unlike with rail and airline workers, the president doesn’t have the authority to order autoworkers to stay on the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowhere will the political fallout of an auto workers strike be felt more than Michigan, which Biden won by nearly 3 percentage points in 2020. The state shifted further during last year’s midterms, leaving the governor’s office and Legislature Democratic-controlled for the first time in 40 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michigan since became the first state in nearly six decades to repeal “right to work” laws limiting union activity that had been approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature in 2012. Still, a strike could shake up politics statewide.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The UAW is a major player in Michigan politics and if there is a strike, of whatever duration, it’ll have a political impact,” said Mark Brewer, former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party. A strike, Brewer said, would leave Biden having “to speak and act consistent with his previous advocacy for working people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That might mean alienating other allies, though, since Biden has in the past received support from top U.S. automakers on the administration’s rules over future sales. And Ray Curry, the former UAW president who was unseated by Fain, had worked with Biden in the past, even attending White House ceremonies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biden was nonetheless anxious to meet Fain given the pair’s shared working-class backgrounds, and they sat down together one-on-one in the Oval Office in July. The White House says it has been in regular touch with the UAW since then, and that overall communication is much better now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are engaged regularly with the parties, and of course seek to support negotiations in any way that is helpful,” said Michigan native and longtime Democratic and Biden adviser Gene Sperling, who the president tapped as the administration’s point person on the autoworker negotiations. “But there is no substitute for the parties staying at the table 24/7 to come to what the president wants to be a win-win agreement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Union support was instrumental in helping Biden overcome a slow start to clinch the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and it helped him win not just Michigan but Wisconsin and Pennsylvania as he defeated Trump in that year’s general election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Underscoring his commitment to organized labor, Biden’s lone campaign rally since launching his reelection bid in April came in June in Philadelphia, when more than a dozen of the country’s largest and most powerful unions endorsed Biden for a second term.\n",
      "\n",
      "So many unions banding together for an unprecedented joint endorsement so early in the election cycle was meant as a show of strength for the president. Conspicuously absent from the event, though, was the UAW. Fain has since said that if Biden wants the UAW’s 2024 endorsement, he’ll have to earn it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other union leaders acknowledged what’s at stake for the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are strikes uncomfortable for an administration?” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which endorsed Biden’s reelection this summer. “Of course they are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, she said, “The administration believes in workers and believes that workers have the power to have a better life through collective organization and through collective bargaining.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is not a soundbite to them,” Weingarten said. “This is a belief system.”\n",

      "Author: ['Paul Glader']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2023-09-12 15:06:09+00:00\n",
      "Content: CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll never be successful,” Errol Musk in 1989 told his 17-year-old son Elon, who was then preparing to fly from South Africa to Canada to find relatives and a college education.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s one of the scenes Walter Isaacson paints in his 670-page biography of Elon Musk, who is now the richest person who ever lived. The biography allows readers new glimpses into the private life of the entrepreneur who popularized electric vehicles for the masses and landed rocket boosters hurtling back to Earth so they could be reused.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Musk’s public statements and actions have become increasingly unhinged, filing and threatening lawsuits against nonprofits that fight hate speech and allowing some of the internet’s worst actors to regain their platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isaacson portrays Musk as a restless genius with a turbulent upbringing on the cusp of launching a new AI company along with his five other companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk allowed Isaacson to shadow him for two years but exercised no control over the biography’s contents, the author said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are four key takeaways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk’s upbringing and father haunt him\n",
      "\n",
      "Isaacson’s book attributes much of Musk’s drive to his upbringing. He recounts the emotional scars inflicted on Musk by his father, which, Isaacson writes, caused Musk to become “a tough yet vulnerable man-child with an exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of mission and a maniacal intensity that was callous and at times destructive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk decided to live with his father from age 10 to 17, enduring what Musk and others describe as occasional but regular verbal taunts and abuse. Musk’s sister, Tosca, said Errol would sometimes lecture his children for hours, “calling you worthless, pathetic, making scarring and evil comments, not allowing you to leave.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elon Musk became estranged from his father, though he has occasionally supported his father financially. In a 2022 email sent to Elon Musk on Father’s Day, Errol Musk said he was freezing and lacking electricity, asking his son for money.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the letter, Errol made racist comments about Black leaders in South Africa. “With no Whites here, the Blacks will go back to the trees,” he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elon Musk has said that he opposes racism and discrimination, but hate speech has flourished on X, formerly known as Twitter, since he purchased it 11 months ago, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Musk threatened to sue the ADL for defamation last week, arguing that the nonprofit’s statements have caused his company to lose significant advertising revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isaacson reported that Errol, in other emails, denounced Covid as “a lie” and attacked Dr. Anthony Fauci, the United States’ former top infectious disease expert who played a prominent role in the government’s fight against the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elon Musk, similarly, has criticized Fauci and raised many questions about public health policy during the pandemic. But he has said he supports vaccination, even if he doesn’t believe the shots should be mandated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk’s fluid family and obsession with population\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk has a fluid mix of girlfriends, ex-wives, ex-girlfriends and significant others, and he has many children with multiple women. Isaacson’s book revealed Musk had a third child (Techno Mechanicus) with the musician Grimes in 2022, and Musk confirmed the revelation Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk has frequently stated that humans must be a multiplanetary species, warning space exploration will ensure the future of humanity. He similarly has spoken numerous times that people need to have more children.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Population collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming,” Musk said last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk has referred to his desire to increase the global population as an explanation for his unique family situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book reports that Musk encouraged employees such as Shivon Zilis, a top operations officer at his Neuralink company, to have many children. “He feared that declining birthrates were a threat to the long-term survival of human consciousness,” Isaacson writes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the book presents their relationship as a platonic work friendship, Musk volunteered to donate sperm to Zilis. She agreed and had twins in 2021 via in vitro fertilization; she did not tell people who the biological father was.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Elon Musk' by Walter Isaacson. Simon & Schuster\n",
      "\n",
      "Zilis and Grimes were friendly, but Musk did not tell Grimes about the twins, according to the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk asked Zilis if her twins might like to take his last name. Isaacson reports that Grimes was upset in 2022 when she learned the news that Musk had fathered children with Zilis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis,” Musk tweeted at the time, trying to defuse the tension. “A collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One of Musk’s children, Jenna, often criticized her father’s wealth specifically and capitalism broadly. In 2022, she disowned her father, which Isaacson reports saddened Musk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isaacson reports that Musk’s fractured relationship with Jenna, who is trans, partly led to Musk’s rightward turn toward libertarianism and questioning what he considers the “woke-mind-virus, which is fundamentally antiscience, antimerit, and antihuman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk has called into question the use of alternate gender pronouns and made numerous statements some critics consider to be anti-trans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare,” Musk posted in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in December 2020 he also posted a tweet, since deleted, that said “when you put he/him in your bio” alongside a drawing of an 18th century soldier rubbing blood on his face in front of a pile of dead bodies and wearing a cap that read “I love to oppress.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Late last year, he tweeted: “My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci.”\n",
      "\n",
      "X, formerly Twitter, is a huge risk\n",
      "\n",
      "The purchase of his favorite social media platform, gutting the staff and tinkering with policies and branding have taken time and resources away from Musk’s other companies and projects, Isaacson reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve got a bad habit of biting off more than I can chew,” Musk told Isaacson at one point.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a protracted legal battle over his decision to purchase Twitter, Musk said he regained his enthusiasm for taking over the company when he realized that he wanted to prevent a world where people silo off into their own echo chambers and would prefer a world of civil discourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Isaacson notes “he would end up undermining that important mission with statements and tweets that ended up chasing off progressives and mainstream media types to other social networks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk team members, such as his business manager Jared Birchall, his lawyer Alex Spiro and his brother Kimbal, sometimes try to restrain Musk from sending text messages or tweets that could create legal or economic peril, according to the book. Some friends convinced him to place his phone in a hotel safe overnight on one occasion, before Musk summoned hotel security to open the safe for him.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The group of experts gathered by the FDA unanimously voted on Tuesday, declaring ingredient phenylephrine to be no more effective than a placebo pill, reported the Associated Press.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phenylephrine can be found in most over-the-counter medications meant to target congestion, including name brands such as Sudafed, and Dayquil, and became the primary ingredient following a 2006 law limiting access to the older pseudoephedrine, which can be processed to create methamphetamine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The efficacy of phenylephrine administered orally to relieve nasal discomfort has been called into question multiple times in the past, including once in 2007. The FDA allowed the drugs to stay on store shelves at that time pending further research, but this week's findings may finally prompt the organization to demand Johnson & Johnson, Bayer and other drugmakers to pull these oral medications completely, reported AP.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this outcome could lead to the FDA pulling phenylephrine from the federally approved list of pill and liquid decongestants, it is unlikely consumers will see an immediate impact, especially because the panel vote is a suggestion but not a binding agreement or determination.\n",
      "\n",

      "Phenylephrine is a decongestant used to relieve nasal pressure and stuffiness often associated with a cold or allergies.\n",
      "\n",
      "It supposedly works by stimulating alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in the arteries, shrinking dilated blood vessels within the nose. This is meant to prevent fluid in the blood vessels from draining into the tissues lining the nose, reliving congestion, according to Drugs.com. It can also be used to increase blood pressure when administered a certain way.\n",

      "One of the main new features the new 2024 Ford F-150 will offer customers is the option of choosing what the company calls the pro access tailgate, which opens from the driver’s side to allow it to be used even when a trailer is hooked up.

      "NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Arm, the chip designer owned by SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), received enough backing from investors to secure at least the top end of the price range in its initial public offering, which would command a $54.5 billion valuation on a fully diluted basis, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters had reported on Sunday that this outcome was likely. After reviewing investor commitments on Tuesday, Arm decided it will only accept the top end of its indicated $47-to-$51-per-share range, or a price that is even higher, the source said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arm may price its IPO above the indicated price range and will decide on how much it will sell its shares for on Wednesday, that source and a second person with knowledge of the matter said. The shares are scheduled to start trading in New York on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arm was considering publishing a revised price range that would have been higher, reflecting the strong investor demand. It decided against such a move, adhering to its more conservative approach to marketing the offering, the sources said. Pricing the approximately $5 billion IPO conservatively raises the chances of the shares trading strongly at their debut on Thursday, the sources added.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Arm and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The valuation that Arm has been seeking thus far represents a climb-down from the $64 billion valuation at which SoftBank last month acquired the 25% stake it did not already own in the company from the $100 billion Vision Fund it manages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet even with this lower valuation, SoftBank would fare better than its $40 billion deal to sell Arm to Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), which it abandoned last year amid opposition from antitrust regulators. SoftBank took Arm private in 2016 for $32 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arm has already signed up many of its major clients as cornerstone investors in its IPO, including Apple (AAPL.O), Nvidia, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), Intel (INTC.O) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS).\n",
      "\n",
      "Arm launched its IPO marketing efforts last week, seeking to convince investors it has growth ahead of it, beyond the mobile phone market, which it dominates with a 99% share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weak mobile demand during a global economic slowdown has caused Arm's revenue to stagnate. Overall sales totaled $2.68 billion in the 12 months to the end of March, compared to $2.7 billion in the prior period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arm told potential investors in New York last Thursday that the cloud computing market, of which it has only a 10% share and therefore more room to expand, is expected to grow at an annual rate of 17% through 2025, partly thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. The automotive market, of which it commands 41%, is forecast to expand by 16%, compared with just 6% growth expected for the mobile market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arm also told investors its royalty fees, which account for most of its revenue, were accumulating since it started collecting them in the early 1990s. Royalty revenue came in at $1.68 billion at the latest fiscal year, up from $1.56 billion a year before.\n",
      "\n",
      "An area of scrutiny for investors has been Arm's exposure to China, given geopolitical tensions with the United States that have led to a race to secure chip supplies. Sales in China contributed 24.5% of Arm's $2.68 billion revenue in fiscal 2023.\n",

      "Author: ['Winston Cho']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2023-09-12 23:15:50+00:00\n",
      "Content: Authors are escalating efforts to block artificial intelligence companies from using their copyrighted works to train artificial intelligence systems, this time taking aim at and OpenAI in proposed class action lawsuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michael Chabon and other decorated writers of books and screenplays sued Meta on Tuesday in California federal court in a lawsuit accusing the company of copyright infringement for harvesting mass quantities of books across the web, which were then used to produce infringing works that allegedly violate their copyrights. OpenAI was sued on Sept. 8 in an identical class action alleging the firms “benefit commercially and profit handsomely from their unauthorized and illegal” collection of the authors’ books. They seek a court order that would require the companies to destroy AI systems that were trained on copyright-protected works.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawsuit is the latest volley from creators in a barrage of court challenges over the legality of the way large language models are trained. OpenAI is facing a proposed class action from author Paul Tremblay, in addition to a suit filed by Sarah Silverman, which also names Meta. Artists have similarly sued AI art generators Stability AI, Midjourney and DeviantArt for copyright infringement.\n",
      "\n",
      "As evidence that AI systems were fed authors’ books, the suit points to ChatGPT generating summaries and in-depth analyses of the themes in the novels when prompted. It says that’s “only possible if the underlying GPT model was trained using” their works.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If ChatGPT is prompted to generate a writing in the style of a certain author, GPT would generate content based on patterns and connections it learned from analysis of that author’s work within its training dataset,” states the complaint, which largely borrows from the suit filed by Tremblay.\n",
      "\n",
      "And because the large language models can’t operate without the information extracted from the copyright-protected material, the answers that ChatGPT produces are “themselves infringing derivative works,” the lawsuit against Meta says.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors allege that OpenAI and Meta built the datasets they use to train their AI systems by “scraping the internet for text data.” In June 2018, OpenAI revealed that it fed GPT-1 — the first iteration of its large language model — a collection of over 7,000 novels on BookCorpus, according to the complaint.\n",
      "\n",
      "“BookCorpus is a controversial dataset, assembled in 2015 by a team of AI researchers funded by Google and Samsung for the sole purpose of training language models like GPT by copying written works from a website called Smashwords, which hosts self-published novels, making them available to readers at no cost,” the lawsuit states. “Despite those novels being largely under copyright, they were copied into the BookCorpus dataset without consent, credit, or compensation to the authors.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The complaint says that later version of OpenAI’s large language models were also trained on illicitly obtained books. The company disclosed in a 2020 paper introducing GPT-3 that the training dataset came from “two-internet based book corpora,” which it referred to as “Books1” and “Book2.” While OpenAI never disclosed the books in the dataset, the authors say that “Books1” based on the Project Gutenberg archive, an online collection of books whose copyrights have expired, which has gained popularity among AI companies. They allege “Books2” is derived from shadow library sites, including Library Gensis, Z-Library and Bibliotick, because “those are the sources of trainable books most similar in nature and size to OpenAI’s desciption” of the dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI no longer discloses information about the sources of its dataset, “[g]iven both the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models like GPT-4,” the company said last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meta similarly doesn’t disclose the origin of the books in its dataset used to train LLaMA, according to the complaint, which is embedded below. While it said that the works came from the “Books3 section of The Pile,” a publicly available dataset for large language models, it doesn’t further describe the contents.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that information is available elsewhere,” reads the complaint, which alleges “Books 3” is composed of books obtained from Bibliotik. “The person who assembled the ‘Books3’ dataset has confirmed in public statements that it represents ‘all of Bibliotik’ and contains 196,640 books.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The class actions seeking to represent a nationwide class of authors in the U.S. whose work was used to train AI systems was brought by Chabon — known for The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, Wonder Boys and The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay — David Henry Hwang and Matthew Klam, among other writers of books and screenplays. They allege direct copyright infringement, vicarious copyright infringement, violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, unjust enrichment and negligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The courts will have to wrestle with two Supreme Court cases considered by legal experts to likely dictate the outcome of the litigation. On one hand, there’s precedent greenlighting the copying of works to generate noninfringing text responses from when the Authors Guild in 2005 sued Google for digitizing millions of books to create a search function. A federal judge in that case rejected copyright infringement claims, finding the company’s utilization of copyrighted works amounts to fair use. Central to the ruling was that Google only allowed users to view snippets of text without providing the full book.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the authors can point to the Supreme Court’s recent decision rejecting a fair use defense in Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts v. Goldsmith. The justices stressed that potentially overlapping commercial exploitation is a key consideration in the analysis, finding that fair use is likely to be rejected when an original work and derivative share the “same or highly similar purpose” and that secondary use is commercial.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Between the two Supreme Court cases, it looks like the courts are going to focus on the nature of the use,” says Ed Klaris, an intellectual property lawyer and professor at Columbia Law School.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, users can direct ChatGPT to generate screenplays in the style of a specific book or author. “When prompted to produce a screenplay in the style of The Dance and The Railroad, ChatGPT produced a script written in Plaintiff Hwang’s style, which generated a screenplay involving a Chinese laborer toiling on the Central Pacific Railroad that ‘believe[s] in the power of art to keep [their] spirits alive,'” the complaint says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on whether the copyright office authorizes the copyrightability of works generated by AI, with companies listing themselves as the owners under the work-for-hire doctrine, studios could turn to optioning a book and have AI write the screenplay. This would likely undermine the market prospects of authors. Stephen Chbosky, author of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Emma Donoghue, author of Room, and Gillian Flynn, author of Gone Girl, all adapted the screenplays to their novels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Klaris predicts that the courts will “rule in favor of creators” if they get to analyzing fair use. He points to arguments from authors and artists that AI firms are actively hurting their economic interests by creating competing works on the backs of their material. This will force AI companies’ hands in creating a licensing framework, he says.\n",

      "Title: China’s growth is buried under great wall of debt\n",
      "Author: ['Yawen Chen']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2023-09-13 01:27:25+00:00\n",
      "Content: LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Where is Wen Jiabao when you need him? China’s former premier is remembered for his decision to unleash a huge state spending plan after the 2008 financial crisis. Today’s leaders wish they could deploy similar fiscal firepower to kickstart their sputtering economy. The options before President Xi Jinping aren’t great. Yet letting some heavily indebted local governments’ investment arms fail would be better than keeping them on pricey life support or counting on an elusive rebound in consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wen exited the political stage a decade ago but his legacy lives on, for better and, mostly, for worse. His plan to throw 4 trillion yuan ($555 billion), or about 13% of China’s GDP in 2008, at everything from railroads to airports contributed to a debt overhang that’s still haunting Beijing today. In the 15 years since, China’s debt-to-GDP ratio has doubled to a whopping 280%, with the bulk of liabilities held by local government financial vehicles (LGFVs).\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of these 3,000-plus entities were created by local governments during the 2008 crisis to skirt a central government ban on direct state borrowing. They were then contracted by regional governments to build public infrastructure, from uneconomical leisure parks and roads to slightly more cost-effective highways, subway stations and high-speed bullet trains. Many also developed land for regional governments before it was sold on to residential developers. Today those vehicles are a ticking time bomb that hampers China’s ability to spend its way out of the current economic doldrums. Economists are busy downgrading the country’s full-year growth to below the official goal of around 5%, which was already seen as modest, because an initial recovery following December’s pandemic reopening quickly faded. China is flirting with deflation as the property sector - which accounts for a quarter of GDP – has sunk and pandemic-scarred consumers and businesses hesitate to spend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xi’s dilemmas are compounded by his belief that the traditional stimulus playbook of boosting real estate has run its course. He has frowned at house prices that made Shanghai less affordable than New York and made an example of over-leveraged developers that disrupted the market, such as China Evergrande (3333.HK), which is struggling to restructure some $300 billion in liabilities. He has eased home purchase curbs recently to stabilise property sales, but they are still on course to decline around 10% this year, per Gavekal Dragonomics.\n",
      "\n",
      "That leaves much of the heavy lifting to fiscal spending. Yet LGFVs’ debt stands in the way. These vehicles had already accumulated 80 trillion yuan of liabilities at the end of 2022, according to analysts at Guosheng Securities. Of that, 54 trillion yuan was interest-bearing, mostly owed to Chinese banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters Graphics\n",
      "\n",
      "The bulk of these debts are separated from local governments’ balance sheets, but Beijing's decade-long efforts to sever the implicit guarantee between local governments and their LGFVs have been largely unsuccessful. A third of LGFVs didn’t generate positive cash flow last year, according to Guosheng. And 60% of them, holding about 32 trillion yuan of outstanding debt, would struggle to pay interest with their own EBITDA, Citi analysts estimated. Yet local officials remain reluctant to let them default on public markets, for fear that such a shock would shut their regions’ funding access and even trigger a run on government bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beijing wants to buy time. Its latest move includes a mooted plan to allow local governments to raise 1 trillion yuan in total through bond sales to repay LGFV debt. The Ministry of Finance may also ask banks to extend loans and slash the interest. Zunyi Road and Bridge Construction, a LGFV in China's Southwestern Guizhou province, set a precedent earlier this year, as its creditor banks agreed to roll over its loans for 20 years and halved interest on them. Xi could also help by letting local governments shuffle their debt into the state’s balance sheet since the central government has a debt-to-GDP ratio of just 20%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem with these measures is that they wouldn’t reduce LGFVs’ pile of debt. A harsher medicine is needed. The shock therapy option for Beijing is to force a fire sale to raise much-needed cash. LGFVs have 133 trillion yuan in total assets, around 60% of which are in land and physical assets such as industrial parks, transport infrastructure and investment properties, according to Guosheng.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters Graphics\n",
      "\n",
      "Local officials have pushed back at Beijing's requests to sell, arguing most of these assets are illiquid, according to the Financial Times. But even if the portfolio of land and fixed assets was put up for sale at a massive 80% discount to entice vulture and bad debt investors, that would raise around 16 trillion yuan, enabling the LGFVs to pay back all their outstanding bonds. At a more optimistic 30% discount, the proceeds would jump to 55 trillion yuan, which would cover all outstanding interest-bearing debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with asset sales, it's inevitable that some LGFVs, especially in poorer regions, will have to fail. Beijing fears that would break the banks. S&P analysts calculate that about 20 trillion yuan of LGFVs’ loans may be at risk of restructuring. Letting these loans roll over with interest slashed - as in Zunyi's case - would result in a 5 trillion yuan hit to bank capital, and reduce banks' average capital adequacy ratio by 2.6 percentage points to 12.6%; that's still within regulatory requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stakes are high. Despite Xi's distaste for propping up the economy through real estate, the danger is that a fire sale of LGFVs’ assets could spark a widespread fall in the value of collateral for bank loans and cause a deeper crisis of confidence. That, in turn, might deal a considerable blow to lenders’ balance sheets and destabilise the financial system.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the banking sector is sitting on 335 trillion yuan of total assets, and bad loans, impairments and provisions will only be an issue once lenders come clean on them. So far, they are not. As of June 2023, Chinese commercial banks claimed that non-performing loans were just 1.6% of all loans. Investors have already priced in more damage and pushed the average valuation of those listed to less than half of book value.\n",
      "\n",
      "The makeup of China’s growth makes drastic action on LGFVs even more imperative. Unlike in the United States and other Western countries, China’s growth is still driven by investment rather than consumption. Investment as a share of GDP is a lofty 40%, according to Oxford Economics, double that of the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chinese households have ample savings, having accumulated 17.8 trillion yuan of bank deposits last year alone. But darkening job prospects, a diminishing wealth effect from real estate, and scars from years of pandemic lockdowns have made them extremely reluctant to spend them.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Xi won't boost property wholeheartedly and is not able to count on consumers, his efforts to revive China’s growth have to focus on smashing the great wall of local debt.\n",

      "UPS CEO Carol Tome introduces U.S. President Donald Trump for an event at a UPS facility at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., July 15, 2020. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "UPS CEO Carol Tome said the costs incurred by the company for the new Teamsters contract are less than the \"$30 billion in new money\" touted by the union, as the company aims to sell investors on the agreement. \"It's not a $30 billion deal,\" Tome told CNBC's Frank Holland in an exclusive interview on Monday. But Tome declined to reveal the internal projection as the company released its first presentation to investors outlining the labor expenses after the bell Monday. UPS said 46% of the compensation in the deal would be in the first year. Tome called the agreement cost-effective and fair. \"It's a barbell structure where it's heavier in the beginning of the contract.\" Tome said. \"We'll go in the middle of the contract and it steps back down. This 46% of the cost increase happens in the first year, so imagine what the last four years of the contract are!\" The increases \"are really good for us and a 3.3% compounded annual growth rate,\" she added. \"That's a deal we'll take every day, but it wasn't just about the money. We've got work/life balance for people, while retaining the ability to deliver on the weekend, which is really important for our customers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Averting a crisis\n",
      "\n",
      "The labor contract reached in July prevented a potentially widespread and disruptive work stoppage. A Teamsters strike would have been the \"costliest in a century,\" creating a $7 billion hit to the U.S. economy in the first 10 days, according to a widely reported estimate from Anderson Economic Group. It also was another milestone in a summer marked by pushes for massive new contracts — and even strikes —‎ in industries ranging from airlines and automaking to television and film. At UPS, full-time drivers will earn up to $170,000 in pay and benefits in the last year of the contract, while part-time workers will see their starting pay rise from $16.20 to $21 an hour.‏ Official negotiations between UPS and the Teamsters began in April, as union leaders urged members to mobilize and create a \"show of force it needs to take on the company.\" In June, Teamsters members authorized a UPS strike during the negotiations. Weeks later, both sides accused the other of walking away from the contract talks. In late July, UPS and the Teamsters announced they had reached a tentative contract agreement. The union ratified the UPS contract on Aug. 25 with record turnout of 58% of members voting and a record 86% approving the deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 'win-win-win'\n",
      "\n",
      "After the tentative deal for the Teamsters contract was reached, Tome called it a \"win-win-win\" for the union, customers and the company. However, UPS shares have fallen more than 14% since the July 25 announcement. Tome also estimated that UPS lost more than 1 million packages per day in volume in the weeks leading up to the eventual deal. \"We can grow now that we have certainty,\" Tome said. \"Because we know what our labor costs are over the next five years, we can put together plans to mitigate that cost, plans to drive productivity inside of our business through automation, which, oh by the way, we retained the ability to do so.\" Tome said the win for customers, as the holiday-shipping peak approaches, is the most important part of the deal. U.S. holiday e-commerce sales are expected to increase by 1% year over year to $273 billion, according to a recent forecast from Salesforce.\n",

      "Content: The American Petroleum Institute (API) has reported a 1.174-million-barrel build in U.S. crude inventories, compared to the previous week's 5.521-million-barrel draw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts were expecting an inventory draw of 2 million barrels for the week. The total number of barrels of crude oil gained so far this year is now in the red, according to API data, and there is a net draw in crude inventories since April of more than 47 million barrels.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Monday, the Department of Energy (DoE) reported that crude oil inventories in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) rose by 300,000 barrels last week, with the SPR inventory still sitting at a near 40-year low of 350.6 million barrels. The amount being funneled into the SPR is a small portion of the hundreds of millions of barrels that were sold off out of the SPR over the last couple of years.\n",

      "Oil prices were trading up substantially on Tuesday ahead of API data, with Brent trading up 1.61% at $92.10 at 11:51 a.m. ET—a $1 gain week over week, while WTI was trading up 1.99%, at $89.03 per barrel—a gain of more than $1 per barrel from this time last week.\n",

      "Author: ['Andrew Bucholtz', 'About Andrew Bucholtz']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2023-09-12 12:35:42+00:00\n",
      "Content: Credit: Charter Spectrum and Disney\n",
      "\n",
      "The Disney-Charter carriage dispute was set up as potentially apocalyptic for both sides. Charter, which provides cable services under the Spectrum brand and had almost 15 million subscribers there before this began in late August, was looking at moving on from Disney-owned channels (including ESPN and ABC) “permanently” without a deal as per their executives’ comments. They had proposed a radically different “glide path” model around a transition to direct-to-consumer subscription services that could have had wide industry impacts on other multichannel video programming distributors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, while claims that ESPN would go “bankrupt” without Spectrum subscribers were always absurd by the numbers, those were advanced by some widely quoted figures. And there was no denying that a permanent Charter loss would have been a major blow to ESPN’s existing linear model and might have had further knock-on effects for other MVPD carriage deals with Disney. The stakes were high here for ESPN as well, and that was reflected in how aggressively they deployed their personalities, including Stephen A. Smith. But in the end, the deal struck Monday to end that 12-day dispute seems to have provided each side some of what they wanted without necessarily transforming anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s more on it from a joint ESPN-Charter press release:\n",
      "\n",
      "In a joint statement Robert A. Iger, Chief Executive Officer, The Walt Disney Company, and Chris Winfrey, President and Chief Executive Officer, Charter Communications said: “Our collective goal has always been to build an innovative model for the future. This deal recognizes both the continued value of linear television and the growing popularity of streaming services, while addressing the evolving needs of our consumers. We also want to thank our mutual customers for their patience this past week, and are pleased that Spectrum viewers once again have access to Disney’s high-quality sports, news and entertainment programming, in time for Monday Night Football.” Among the key deal points: In the coming months, the Disney+ Basic ad-supported offering will be provided to customers who purchase the Spectrum TV Select package, as part of a wholesale arrangement; ESPN+ will be provided to Spectrum TV Select Plus subscribers;\n",
      "\n",
      "The ESPN flagship direct-to-consumer service will be made available to Spectrum TV Select subscribers upon launch and;\n",
      "\n",
      "Charter will maintain flexibility to offer a range of video packages at varying price points based upon different customer’s viewing preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charter will maintain flexibility to offer a range of video packages at varying price points based upon different customer’s viewing preferences. Charter also will use its significant distribution capabilities to offer Disney’s direct-to-consumer services to all of its customers – in particular its large broadband-only customer base – for purchase at retail rates. These include Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, as well as The Disney Bundle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for the moment, the deal means Charter gets some of the “free Disney streaming apps” they had lobbied for, but not all of them. They only get to provide ESPN+ for free in a higher tier than their normal tier, and while that basic tier now comes with Disney+, that’s the ad-supported version. And they get no discount on Hulu.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Charter does get to pull a lot of Disney channels that do have programming duplicated on Disney+ and Hulu, including Baby TV, Disney Junior, Disney XD, Freeform, FXM, FXX, Nat Geo Wild, and Nat Geo Mundo. And they get to offer that linear ESPN DTC service when it launches in 2025 or 2026 (although, there’s as yet been no mention of that service offering anything more than linear ESPN, which Charter already offers under this deal). And they get unspecified “flexibility” on video package range, which could presumably let them offer cheaper packages without ESPN and/or some of its networks (similar to what they’ve done with entertainment-focused packages without RSNs and league networks).\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, ESPN networks and ABC are now back on Charter, and they get to again add in those subscribers who haven’t yet canceled. And that’s a big boost for them on multiple fronts. Firstly, it boosts their income from per-subscriber fees, regardless of whether those subscribers ever watch anything on those channels. Secondly, it improves the household reach for ESPN and its networks. Thirdly, it jacks up the ratings (and thus, the advertising dollars) for ESPN broadcasts. So this is quite important for the futures of Disney and ESPN.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this is a deal that has some merits for both sides, but not one likely to transform the TV ecosystem (as some had expected it might). Both sides gave a bit, and both sides have some things to be happy with out of this. And this could pay further benefits down the road. Charter did get some of what they were looking for in terms of access to Disney OTT apps for their subscribers, and they and Disney could both benefit from Charter marketing the unincluded versions of Disney DTC apps to Spectrum subscribers.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it’s notable that Charter has secured full ESPN linear DTC access for subscribers when that launches. While that’s currently worth next to nothing (it’s just the ESPN feed already being offered through their cable package, so this would just be an alternate way to watch it, and authentication-required web streaming is already a thing), it’s a useful hedge in case Disney tries to throw more exclusive content in there (ESPN++, anyone)? Meanwhile, Disney now has Charter and their subscribers (and their juicy per-subscriber fees) locked in for a while, helping them maintain their linear offerings while they try to ramp up their direct-to-consumer offerings.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this deal alone is not going to blow up the existing model in favor of either side. It may well present a useful pathway for future carriage negotiations, and it certainly seems likely that other MVPDs may be able to get at least this level of OTT app access for their subscribers in future negotiations. But it’s not as radical a departure as people from either side had proposed. While that probably has some merit (the current model still has some benefits for programmers, distributors, and consumers, so an instant implosion carries problems for all), it does mean this deal alone isn’t going to be the watershed some had expected.\n",

      "Content: CHARLOTTE — In the battle over a broken lease, clothing retailer American Eagle says Northlake Mall was “reminiscent of a warzone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s according to new court documents obtained Tuesday by Channel 9′s Joe Bruno. After Northlake Mall filed lawsuits against five stores for breaking their leases, American Eagle is fighting back with a bold counterclaim against the mall’s operators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spinoso Real Estate Group, which operates the mall in north Charlotte, sued American Eagle and others in late July, alleging that the store vacated and abandoned the premises on April 29. The original lawsuit said American Eagle had a lease through Jan. 31, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "American Eagle’s parent company, AE Outfitters Retail Co., responded with the counterclaim on Tuesday, saying that the lease permits the company to leave the store unattended “due to emergency events beyond tenant’s anticipation and control.”\n",
      "\n",
      "American Eagle claims that “rampant violence at Northlake Mall” and a new chaperone policy for teen shoppers “constitute such emergency events.”\n",
      "\n",
      "AE says in the lawsuit that Spinoso promised to lease them space in a shopping center “in accordance with the standards of first-class shopping centers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Instead, Spinoso allowed the shopping center - Northlake Mall - to deteriorate into an atmosphere reminiscent of a warzone, replete with violent criminals, multiple shootings, terrorized tenants and customers, and diminished business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawsuit claims the Apple store moved out of the mall after three shootings at Northlake Mall. Channel 9 reported on at least three shootings in the area since last October:\n",
      "\n",
      "After a rash of shootings, the mall’s operators put in a new policy saying children under 18 had to be accompanied by an adult after 3 p.m. on weekends. The lawsuit says that policy affected “a substantial percentage of AEO Retail’s customer base” because it prevented teenagers from shopping at its store “during key retail times.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the shootings continued, Spinoso increased security measures like adding K-9 patrol and firearms detectors. The lawsuit claims they were “security measures that one might expect at a prison.”\n",
      "\n",
      "American Eagle isn’t stopping at getting out of the lease, either. The company wants to take Spinoso to trial to determine how much the mall operator should pay for harm to AE’s business. The claims say the damages are in excess of $75,000.\n",

      "Author: ['Greg Hadley', 'Sept.', 'John A. Tirpak']\n",

      "Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. and contractor Northrop Grumman both unveiled new imagery of the secretive B-21 Raider, the first glimpse of the stealthy bomber in months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two Air Force images, released during Brown’s keynote address at AFA’s Air, Space & Cyber Conference and dated July 31, showcase the bomber at Northrop Grumman’s Palmdale, Calif., facility. Notably, one shows the B-21 outdoors, a rare sighting of the aircraft outside the hangar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Separately, Northrop Grumman announced Sept. 12 that the B-21 has begun engine runs as part of its ground testing program and released another picture of the aircraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most prominent new feature shown in the new images is an air data probe mounted on the front of the aircraft below the nose; a test item which will not be a feature of operational aircraft. The probe is angled downwards, suggesting the airplane may fly with a slight pitch-up attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "The B-21 Raider is designed with an open systems architecture, enabling rapid insertion of mature technologies and allowing the aircraft to be effective as threats evolve. The B-21 first flight is anticipated to take place in calendar year 2023. U.S. Air Force photo\n",
      "\n",
      "The images also emphasize how narrow the air intakes on the aircraft are—a marked contrast to the Air Force’s other stealth bomber, the B-2 Spirit—as well as the B-21’s simpler landing gear doors. The photos also appear to show the B-21’s flight control surfaces for the first time, seemingly three per side of the flying wing aircraft, and they seem larger than those on the B-2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outdoor image of the B-2 also reveals a serrated indentation on the top of the airframe behind the cockpit. The feature may be part of the air refueling receptacle system, which is in a similar position on the on the B-2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The side windows of the B-21 seem smaller, wider and lower than was suggested in earlier artist’s concepts. A dark band sloping up onto the fuselage from the tail could be an extension of an infrared suppression system similar to that on the B-2, which uses space shuttle-tile-like materials to trap and disperse heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Air data sensors like those on the B-2 are prominent on the front of the aircraft in the hangar image. Black bands prominent beneath the windscreen could be air data sensors, a de-icing feature, or both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using ground crew in the hangar photo as a gauge, the aircraft appears to have a wingspan of approximately 135-155 feet, versus 172 feet for the B-2.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The Air Force rolled out the B-21, its first new bomber in more than three decades, in December 2022 at Northrop’s plant in Palmdale. The flashy ceremony, attended by Pentagon dignitaries, industry officials, and media, showcased some new features on what Northrop is dubbing the world’s first “sixth-generation” aircraft but also kept the general public at a distance from the secretive plane, whose full capabilities are still classified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in March, the service released two more images of the B-21. Since then, however, there has been no sight of the bomber emerging from the hangar, either for ground or flight tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Northrop did announce in July that the bomber accomplished its first “power on” test in recent months, moving it another step closer to a first flight that is still scheduled to take place before the end of 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "No firm timeline has been set for that first flight, and in its most recent release, Northrop emphasized that it would be a “a data driven event.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In his speech, Brown highlighted the B-21 as “a perfect example of successful design implementation, of operators and acquisition professionals working together to deliver capability to the warfighter.

      "Content: Coca-Cola has taken a fizzy leap into the future of AI hype with the release of Coca‑Cola Y3000 Zero Sugar, a \"limited-edition\" beverage reportedly co-created with artificial intelligence. Its futuristic name evokes flavor in the year 3000 (still 977 years away), but its marketing relies on AI-generated imagery from 2023—courtesy of the controversial image synthesis model Stable Diffusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stable Diffusion, a technology which is mentioned by name when launching the \"Coca-Cola Y3000 AI Cam\" mobile app, gained its ability to generate images by scraping hundreds of millions of copyrighted works found on the Internet without copyright holder permission and is currently the subject of litigation related to copyright infringement.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is no hint of that controversy in Coca-Cola's marketing materials, which lean heavily into today's buzzy, AI-centered tech zeitgeist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We hope that Coca‑Cola will still be as relevant and refreshing in the year 3000 as it is today, so we challenged ourselves to explore the concept of what a Coke from the future might taste like—and what kind of experiences would a Coke from the future unlock?\" Oana Vlad, Coke's senior director of global strategy, said in a press release.\n",
      "\n",
      "To explore that hypothetical future, Coca-Cola developed a mystery flavor and wrapped it in an AI-themed marketing package and mobile web-based app that draws upon both human designers and the aforementioned Stable Diffusion. There's no direct reference to AI being used to develop the flavor beyond this one statement: \"Fans’ perspectives from around the world, combined with insights gathered from artificial intelligence, helped inspire Coca‑Cola to create the unique taste of Y3000.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "The lack of an AI mixologist at the helm is probably a good thing because AI has been known to concoct questionable recipes. Nobody needs toxic ingredients accidentally confabulated into their soda recipe. (Would Coca-Cola feed its vaulted top-secret recipe through a commercial cloud AI model, such as ChatGPT, anyway?)\n",
      "\n",
      "While there may be no AI flavors involved, the company talks about using AI to develop Y3000's graphical branding: \"Coca‑Cola Y3000 Zero Sugar sports an equally futuristic—and optimistic—visual identity. Co-created with artificial intelligence, the design showcases liquid in a morphing, evolving state, communicated through form and color changes that emphasize a positive future.\"\n",

      "The graphic design is not the only place Stable Diffusion plays a part in the Y3000 marketing package. On its website, Coca-Cola provides an AI-augmented QR code (likely generated with a recently discovered Stable Diffusion technique). When scanned on a mobile phone, the code takes thirsty users to the \"Coca‑Cola Creations Hub,\" where they can take photos with their device camera and filter them through Stable Diffusion to have a vaporwave-style futuristic look.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it stands today, the term \"artificial intelligence\" is a technical term of art, yet it's also arguably sometimes meaningless due to misunderstandings and misuse. Now that it has become marketing jargon for a multinational food and beverage company, the trend toward watering down AI's meaning seems likely to continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coca-Cola says that the zero-sugar version of the new AI-augmented soda will be available for a limited time in \"select markets\" including the United States, Canada, China, Europe, and Africa.

      "\n",
      "Kroger and Albertsons unveiled their plans last week to sell more than 400 stores, including at least 49 stores in Oregon, to C&S Wholesale Grocers as part of their efforts to win regulatory approval for their planned merger. The sale agreement is intended to appease federal antitrust regulators who are scrutinizing how the merger would curb customer choices and reduce competition in the grocery industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "New Hampshire-based C&S Wholesale Grocers has agreed to pay $1.9 billion to acquire 413 stores — including some from Kroger’s QFC chains and Albertsons’ Safeway — spread out across 17 states and Washington, D.C., from Kroger and Albertsons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deal includes the sale of the QFC, Carrs and Mariano’s banners to C&S, as well as a licensing arrangement that would allow C&S to use the Albertsons brand name in Arizona, California, Colorado and Wyoming, according to announcements from the companies. All fuel centers and pharmacies associated with the divested stores will remain open.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred Meyer’s retail network will remain intact, said Tiffany Sanders, corporate affairs manager for the Kroger subsidiary.\n",

      "In a statement, Sanders said that the divestiture plan “includes the sale of the QFC banner name and some QFC stores but does not include the sale of any Fred Meyer stores at this time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The agreement also includes selling eight distribution centers and two corporate offices to C&S Wholesale Grocers. Sanders did not immediately respond to questions about whether Fred Meyer’s distribution centers or corporate offices in Oregon will remain intact.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because we are still in the regulatory process, we are not able to share the specific locations included in the agreement,” Sanders said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, Kroger also declined to specify which stores in Oregon would be sold off to C&S. The company also declined to say whether the Fred Meyer corporate office in Portland would be among the two slated to be sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kroger and Albertsons each operate more than 2,000 stores across the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "The divestiture plan also includes 104 stores in Washington state and 13 from the Albertsons portfolio in Idaho.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sale agreement allows Kroger to require C&S to purchase up to 237 additional stores as part of the effort by Kroger and Albertsons to satisfy regulators reviewing their proposed merger.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not clear whether Fred Meyer locations could be sold if regulators require the combined chain to part with more stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanders said in a statement that C&S has “agreed to honor all collective bargaining agreements, securing the future of good-paying union jobs and protecting associates’ industry-leading health care and pension benefits as well as bargained-for wages.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Founded in 1918, C&S is a wholesale supplier to more than 7,500 independent supermarkets, retail chain stores and military bases. It runs Grand Union grocery stores and Piggly Wiggly franchise and corporate-owned stores in the Midwest, the Carolinas, New York and Vermont. It also operates a wholesale warehouse in Troutdale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sell-off is part of Kroger’s efforts to mollify antitrust regulars at the Federal Trade Commission who are evaluating the proposed merger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kroger, the nation’s largest supermarket chain, which bought Fred Meyer in 1998, announced plans in October to buy its next largest competitor, Albertsons Cos. Inc., for $24.6 billion. The companies hope to finalize the sale early next year.\n",

NVDA, -0.68% fell 0.3% in morning trading, putting then in danger of a fifth-straight loss, as the semiconductor maker and artificial-intelligence play tracked the weakness in the chip sector and the broader stock market.

The company is backing an oil giant, Occidental Petroleum, to help it do just that. Amazon announced today that it plans to purchase 250,000 metric tons of carbon removal from Occidental subsidiary 1PointFive.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the latest in a stream of announcements from Big Tech companies turning to emerging carbon removal technologies to help them meet their climate goals. Sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere is one way to try to undo the damage caused by pollution companies have already created. But much of the carbon removal industry has deep ties to oil and gas. And when companies like Amazon pay to deal with their pollution this way, it doesn’t necessarily stop them from continuing to create more of the pollution by burning fossil fuels.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the latest in a stream of announcements from Big Tech companies turning to emerging carbon removal technologies to help them meet their climate goals\n",
      "\n",
      "1PointFive, the subsidiary of Occidental, has plans to build massive industrial facilities, called direct air capture (DAC) plants, in Texas that are supposed to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Amazon says that the CO2 will then be sequestered underground to keep it from escaping back into the atmosphere. Occidental, however, has also used carbon removal to sell what it calls “net-zero oil,” produced by shooting CO2 into the ground in order to push out hard-to-reach oil reserves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Biden administration has arguably been just as jazzed about carbon removal as tech companies have. The Department of Energy (DOE) chose to fund a project 1PointFive is developing at King Ranch in Texas as the site of one of the first “hubs” for direct air capture plants in the US. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed in 2021 earmarks $3.5 billion in federal funding for at least four DAC hubs across the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, Microsoft announced that it would purchase 315,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide removal from another hub the DOE is funding in Louisiana. That project is led by California startup Heirloom and Swiss company Climeworks. Climeworks was one of the first companies in the world to build CO2-sucking industrial plants and has already captured an unspecified amount of CO2 for Microsoft, Stripe, and Shopify at its facility in Iceland.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of its carbon removal purchase from Occidental’s 1PointFive, Amazon also said today that it is “making an investment” in another California-based DAC company called CarbonCapture that will provide Amazon with credits worth 100,000 tons of carbon removal. CarbonCapture is building another big direct air capture plant in Wyoming. But there’s a key difference. Both CarbonCapture and Climeworks have previously told The Verge that they have no plans to use their technology in tandem with oil production in the way that Occidental has.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon’s announcement today is a pretty big purchase for the burgeoning carbon removal industry, but it still represents a fraction of the company’s greenhouse gas emissions. By The Verge’s estimate, Amazon’s purchase from 1PointFive could add up to as much as $150,000,000 (direct air capture typically costs around $600 per ton of CO2, although policymakers are trying to bring that price down with incentives). Occidental also plans to use Amazon Web Services to “analyze real-time performance data and optimize operations” at its future DAC plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wall Street Journal estimated that Microsoft’s purchase from Heirloom last week cost around $200 million. While that might be a lot of money, the amount of carbon dioxide Microsoft and Amazon are paying to capture still pales in comparison to how much climate pollution they continue to produce.\n",

      "\n",
      "Emanating from the dense maze of pipes and towers the size of a city block is the roar of carbon dioxide escaping into the atmosphere — exactly what Chevron Corp.’s ambitious $2.1 billion system was supposed to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gorgon project sits 60 kilometers (37 miles) off the northwest coast of Australia next to a vast gas field. Chevron received approval to develop the site into a major liquefied natural gas export facility on the basis they could capture and store 80% of the CO2 mixed in with the fuel, instead of releasing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since LNG production started in 2016, they mostly haven’t. Mitigation operations started late, ran in spurts and were beset with technical issues. Right now, while the facility is successfully capturing CO2, it is only storing 1.6 million tons per year, under half its 4 million tons capacity, after struggling to inject the gas into the ground reliably.\n",

      "\n",
      "Carbon capture and storage is one of the most contentious solutions in the drive to cut greenhouse gas emissions. In the last three decades, according to BloombergNEF data, governments and corporations have poured over $83 billion into projects. Last year the technology captured just 0.1% of global emissions.\n",

      "Yet enthusiasm at Chevron, the second-biggest US oil and gas producer, is undimmed. It’s planning to press on, spending even more money on the divisive technology, both at Gorgon and elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We gotta get started and really get going,” said Chris Powers, vice president of carbon capture, utilization and storage at Chevron’s New Energies unit and the company veteran charged with getting Gorgon back on track. “These are multi-year projects that are gonna take, many, many, many millions of dollars to progress.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest problems is that unlike technologies such as solar, which have reached mass scale and are now close to drop-in solutions, CCS is still a bespoke suite of processes. It’s expensive, site-specific and has needed custom engineering virtually everywhere it’s been tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many environmentalists say the technology should be abandoned, arguing it is simply a way for the fossil fuel industry to justify its continued existence and to avoid having to write down the value of its assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet CCS is also one of the world’s last best hopes to limit dangerous warming.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world is filled with high-emission, high-cost infrastructure like power stations and factories that cannot be easily scrapped in favor of green alternatives. In some cases, because the assets were recently built in cash-strapped countries who can’t afford to decommission them. In others, because there isn’t yet a commercially viable way for industries like cement and steel smelting to decarbonize. If CCS technology can be retrofitted, the world gains valuable time.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why climate scientists from the likes of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – hardly apologists for Big Oil – say CSS is an unavoidable necessity.\n",

      "Roughly another 300 facilities of similar size to Gorgon need to be up and running by 2030 to keep the world on track for net-zero emissions by the middle of this century, according to Bloomberg News calculations based on scenario planning from the International Energy Agency.\n",

      "But after decades of slow progress, time is quickly running out. As projects normally take five to seven years from announcement to commissioning, that gives the industry just two years to build trust in CCS and significantly scale-up investment. Some $4.5 trillion is needed by 2030, according to BloombergNEF.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gorgon, incongruously perched on a nature reserve of red dirt, scrappy vegetation and rare marsupials, is one of the projects that simply must hit its targets to convince skeptics that the technology is viable.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the early-1970s Chevron made history by injecting leftover CO2 captured from an oil field to produce more fuel at scale. Usually, the gas would have been vented but instead engineers used it like soap to squeeze out extra oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next 30 years this was the main application of carbon capture: not constraining greenhouse gas emissions but producing even more fossil fuels. Then as concerns about global warming gathered pace, the industry started to experiment with using CCS to operate refineries and gas fields with a lower carbon footprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s been a frustrating journey. Some 78% of large-scale demonstration and pilot projects initiated between 1995 to 2018 have been canceled or put on hold, according to a 2021 study. High costs were a key issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IEA says that currently 40 projects globally are capturing carbon at a commercial level. That’s in sharp contrast to the exponential increase in wind and solar installations.\n",
      "\n",
      "One project the industry often touts as a success is Quest in Scotford, Canada, operated by Shell Plc. It handles emissions from a facility that creates hydrogen to upgrade bitumen from oil sands fields, allowing the thick fuel to be refined into products like gasoline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shell’s Quest carbon capture and storage project in Scotford, Canada. Photographer: Jason Franson/Bloomberg\n",
      "\n",
      "Built on time and under budget, it’s operated near its full 1 million tons a year capacity for the first seven years of operation – although the actual volume of avoided emissions is lower because the site generates other pollution that is not captured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Learning from Quest’s construction, Shell hopes to use modularized designs and existing technologies in future endeavors, reducing the need for heavily engineered systems tailored for individual projects. That approach could also help cut costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't talk about CCS, we are doing CCS,” said Zoe Yujnovich, head of Shell’s integrated gas and upstream business, which is responsible for exploration and production. CCS is “absolutely critical for my business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Quest is also one of the projects that Chevron’s Powers, 43, a jovial chemical engineer by training, is looking to for lessons. Weeks before he started the role, Chevron announced that it aims to capture and offset 25 million tons per year by 2030, equivalent to about six Gorgons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Powers — like much of the wider oil and gas industry — says making CCS work is non-negotiable if the world wants to maintain its current style of living.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I just fundamentally don’t believe that society is willing to sort of go back to the Old West or Stone Age,” said Powers. “We’re doing an important thing here to feed the growing demand of energy in the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Powers is a third-generation oil man. His grandfather did construction work on refineries and chemical plants. His father was a chemical engineer involved in the processing of hydrocarbons. “And now we’re capturing CO2 that’s critical to the quality of life that we all have, and putting it back to the ground — that’s the personal story I tell folks, it’s sort of full cycle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Most CCS projects share some core elements. They use chemical solvents to remove CO2 in towers; pipes to cool, heat and transport the gas; and then pressurized systems to store it, often within hollow natural caverns that were once home to fossil fuels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineering in remote locations always requires some degree of ingenuity. On Barrow Island, for example, the equipment that flares gas — an approach used in emergencies to relieve dangerous pressure build-ups — had to be separated to be further inland and surrounded by massive black walls so that turtles wouldn’t think it’s the moon and use it to navigate the island.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet when it comes to CCS, the degree of customization required is extreme.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Gorgon back in 2017, trace amounts of water in the pipes transporting the CO2 triggered an acidic reaction that was rapidly eroding the equipment. Chevron had to stop all CO2 transport until engineers finally decided they could fix the problem by installing machines that dehydrated the CO2. That delayed start-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is not a cookie cutter technology,” said Christina Ng, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a non-profit which advocates for a transition away from fossil fuels. “It is so specific, it is so sensitive to the location which it is put in, it cannot be replicated easily to just anywhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, issues with water and pressure management when injecting CO2 are plaguing the facility. Solutions being reviewed include removing and transferring water into another reservoir nearby, allowing CO2 to be injected at a higher rate. The price tag is still being determined.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, to make-up for the shortfall, Chevron must buy millions of tons of carbon offsets, including from a market that’s been criticized for failing to abate greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the industry’s difficulties, all around the world governments are doubling down. President Joe Biden’s US Inflation Reduction Act contains the provision for tax credits which could cover the cost of building and operating carbon capture facilities. The UK is committing as much as £20 billion to subsidize CCS over the next two decades, while the European Union aims to inject 50 million tons a year by 2030 — a 66% increase on what is currently planned.\n",
      "\n",
      "G-20 leaders gathering in New Delhi agreed to support the expansion of abatement technologies, reflecting a wider retreat from ambitions to rapidly phase out fossil fuels. This year’s COP28 United Nations climate summit in the United Arab Emirates will also advocate strongly for the technology. “In any realistic scenario that gets us to net zero, carbon capture technology will have a role to play,” COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber said in a May speech. “Without it, the math just doesn’t add up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And in Japan, CCS is the centerpiece of its transition plan. Instead of pivoting quickly to cheaper wind and solar generation like most of its G7 peers to decarbonize its power sector, authorities are counting on the technology to extend the life and cut emissions from its massive coal and gas plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "By 2050, it plans to have the equivalent of as many as 60 Gorgons operational. It’s a high-risk strategy, because any hiccups threaten to derail efforts to curb pollution in the second half of the century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key to its hopes for a breakthrough are innovation hubs like Omuta, on the southern island of Kyushu. Once home to one of Japan’s oldest coal mines, for over a decade it’s housed a team of Toshiba Corp. engineers. Currently, they are trying to couple CCS with the next door Mikawa biomass plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bio-energy with carbon capture storage in Omuta, Japan. Source: Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the fuel at Mikawa is renewable — it burns palm kernel shells — capturing the emissions would make it carbon negative, at least in theory. The facility runs for short testing periods during the frigid winter and blistering hot summer, providing vital datapoints for Toshiba and Japan’s nascent CCS industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The project is so experimental small metal placards hang off every inch of the plant to let engineers know exactly what each piece does. They chime every time the wind blows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toshiba and its partners plan to liquefy the CO2. Japan is looking to potentially send CO2 to places like Australia, which has more room for storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "For skeptics, CCS is nothing more than a fantasy get-out-of-jail-free card for polluters, sucking up cash that would be better deployed elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s great propaganda in the sense that it gives the user the notion that we can keep burning fossil fuels and not have so many emissions,” said Charles Harvey, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Put the subsidies into the technologies that are good, that work, that are efficient.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And it’s those who stand to gain most who are often the strongest proponents. Toshiba, for example, is also a large supplier of turbines for fossil fuel power plants. Plus CCS is one of the few ways to reconcile environmental targets with the decision by a number of large oil and gas producers to cut output at a slower rate than previously planned in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n",

      "Barrow Island is dotted with oil wells drilled in previous decades. Many are still oscillating up and down today, producing a tiny bit of crude next to bulbous termite hills and the native spectacled hare-wallabies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The natural gas the island is now focused on is in high demand as a so-called transition fuel as Asian nations seek to move away from dirtier coal. But Australia is bearing the carbon cost nonetheless: the Gorgon project was the country’s largest polluter during the year through June 2022, according to the latest available data from the regulator.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all the site’s setbacks, there are successes that give the company optimism. Underneath the dusty red earth, pipes are actually transporting some CO2, captured and condensed to a supercritical state, roughly two kilometers underground.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the three injection sites there is no ear-wrenching racket of equipment, or even a modest hum. You’d only know the wells are operating as intended by the constantly changing numbers on small digital monitors.\n",

      "“We’re about to put significantly more dollars on the ground to take the capacity up to our desired optimal rate,” said Chevron’s Powers. “Although we’re not fully where we wanna be, we can actually point to and say we are operating a project that is capturing the CO2.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That sentiment sums up the carbon capture industry. For decades, the industry has had something to point at to say the technology works. Yet despite these accomplishments, it’s not currently operating at a large enough scale to make a meaningful impact in slowing down climate change.\n",

      "Publish Date: None\n",
      "Content: Tesla stock (TSLA) popped this week — 6% on Monday — as influential Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas talked up the artificial intelligence and Dojo supercomputer prospects for the electric vehicle maker. The Dojo effect will be even bigger on the so-called Muskonomy, which Jonas dubbed the other companies in the Musk empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "But first, a primer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla's Dojo supercomputer consists of several \"system trays\" of the company’s in-house D1 chips, which are built into cabinets that then merge into an \"ExaPOD\" supercomputer. Several ExaPODs can be strung together in clusters, making even more powerful supercomputers.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Morgan Stanley, a version of the Dojo supercomputer has been up and running since July and will eventually have the power to crunch FSD (full-self driving) visual data from the 400,000+ vehicles running FSD software, in order to train Tesla’s AI model and FSD chips inside every Tesla vehicle. This is what Tesla had in mind for Dojo — to accelerate its self-driving and other AI-driven software initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will the \"Muskonomy\" rule the world? Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla, in Paris in June. (REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes)\n",
      "\n",
      "But Musk has said recently that Tesla also envisions a scenario where it can use Dojo as a cloud SaaS (software as a service) supercomputer for other companies, and charge hefty fees for its use, like Amazon (AMZN) does with its AWS cloud product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jonas believes Tesla’s Network Services (SaaS/Dojo cloud services) will not only be a revenue driver for the company, but also will help boost the prospects of Musk’s other businesses: X (formerly Twitter), SpaceX, Tesla’s battery business, and even Neuralink and the Boring Company. This is what Jonas calls the \"Muskonomy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We think that there's a possibility that the Dojo system isn’t just being built to accelerate and train FSD and Optimus (Tesla bot); rather it could be a solution that builds a moat around Tesla and Musk-universe companies with highly advanced ML (machine learning) and AI capabilities,\" Jonas wrote to his clients. \"Looking internally at other Musk companies, we believe that Dojo may have the capability to be the core of the Muskonomy.\"\n",

      "Story continues\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla's Dojo Supercomputer ExaPODs (credit: Tesla)\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, \"Twitter can benefit from shifting away from its current compute systems and switching to no/low-cost data computation from the most powerful supercomputer systems in the world, greatly accelerating the platform to new heights,\" Jonas wrote. Owning and operating a free speech platform like Twitter/X provides a number of challenges — and supercomputing has the potential to handle multiple tasks like content moderation for example, and perhaps even advertising optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "SpaceX is another company, with its vast array of satellites, that could benefit from supercomputer capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since the satellites communicate through lasers, large amounts of data is required for precise measurements needed to connect and hand off [data to other satellites],\" Jonas said, adding that \"immense computational power is required in the field of orbital debris mitigation and avoidance for the satellites need to avoid collisions, where the required metrology can benefit from AI computations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, battery design and construction can require a substantial amount of supercomputer and AI power.\n",
      "\n",

      "Author: []\n",
      "Publish Date: None\n",
      "Content: Virtu broker-dealer also charged with failure to establish, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures to protect sensitive customer information\n",
      "\n",
      "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n",
      "\n",
      "2023-176\n",
      "\n",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against broker-dealer Virtu Americas LLC and its parent company, Virtu Financial Inc. (collectively, Virtu), for making materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding information barriers to prevent the misuse of sensitive customer information.\n",
      "\n",
      "As alleged in the SEC's complaint, Virtu Americas and its affiliates operated two businesses that it purported to have walled off from each other: an order execution service for large institutional customers, whereby Virtu Americas executed customer orders, typically for a commission, and a proprietary trading business, through which Virtu Americas bought and sold securities for its own accounts and benefit. From approximately January 2018 through the beginning of April 2019, however, Virtu Americas allegedly failed to safeguard a database that contained all post-trade information generated from customer orders routed to, and executed by, Virtu Americas, including customer identifying information and other material nonpublic information. The SEC’s complaint alleges that this database was accessible to practically anyone at Virtu Americas and its affiliates, including their proprietary traders, through two sets of widely known and frequently shared generic usernames and passwords. Virtu Americas’ failure to safeguard this information created significant risk that its proprietary traders could misuse it or share it outside Virtu Americas. For example, a Virtu Americas proprietary trader allegedly could observe that Virtu Americas had executed the orders of a large institutional customer throughout the day, understand that the same customer may follow a similar trading pattern over the next days, and take advantage of such information by trading ahead of the customer’s subsequent orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, during this fifteen-month period when Virtu Americas failed to establish, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of that information, Virtu misled customers about the existence and adequacy of such information barriers. As alleged in the SEC’s complaint, in some instances Virtu overstated the controls, barriers and processes it had in place to secure its institutional customers’ post-execution trade data, and in others falsely represented to those customers that only employees with a need to see such information – a group that did not include proprietary traders – could do so. Following these false and misleading statements, a number of institutional customers continued to use Virtu Americas to execute their orders, resulting in significant commissions for Virtu Americas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At a time when Virtu Americas handled around a quarter of all market orders placed by retail investors in the U.S., we allege that proprietary traders had nearly unfettered access to material nonpublic information about its institutional customers’ trades – information which could be abused for personal gain,” said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “Despite the absence of any critical safeguards whatsoever around this information, we further allege that Virtu repeatedly misled institutional customers and the market about how Virtu Americas was protecting this valuable data to generate significant commissions. Today’s enforcement action not only holds Virtu accountable for its failings, but also sends a strong message to firms that they must do much more than use shared, generic usernames and passwords to protect against and prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Virtu allegedly painted a materially misleading picture as to the safeguards it had in place to protect its customers’ confidential information, even when customers specifically asked about the firm’s handling of their post-trade information,” said Carolyn M. Welshhans, Associate Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division. “As our enforcement action shows, the SEC is committed to ensuring that firms provide accurate information for customers to make their investment decisions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The SEC’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Virtu violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and that Virtu Americas violated Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Alexandra M. Arango and David Bennett of the Market Abuse Unit, and supervised by David A. Becker, Paul Kim, Joseph Sansone, and Ms. Welshhans. The litigation will be led by Damon Taaffe under the supervision of James Carlson and James Connor. The Division of Examinations conducted an examination that contributed to the investigation.\n",

      "Content: KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Evergy has sought permission to change the default plan for customers who do not select one of four new time-based plans that go into effect next month.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Missouri Public Service Commission ordered Evergy to switch to time-based plans for peak summer hours in November 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, the electric utility is offering four plans for Missouri residential customers — the Standard Peak Saver, the Peak Reward Saver, the Nights and Weekends Saver, and the Nights and Weekends Max Saver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, the Standard Peak Saver — which features high rates from 4-8 p.m. on weekdays and low rates the rest of the week, including weekends and holidays — is the default plan for customers who don’t pick a plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the requested change, Evergy is asking for permission to change the default plan to the Peak Reward Saver plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "It offers less savings during off-peak hours, but also charges a lower rate during peak weeknight hours compared with the Standard Peak Saver plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Evergy has always advocated for customer rate choice and does not support mandated time-based rates,” Evergy’s Chief Customer Officer Chuck Caisley said in a statement. “Customers, elected officials and other stakeholders have clearly voiced their concerns about mandating summer peak pricing, and we appreciate that the Commission is willing to listen to this feedback. We have asked to change the default rate to one that provides a smaller price change during peak times and to allow customers to opt back into an ‘anytime’ rate, like we offer today, before the 2024 summer months.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Evergy also is asking the Public Service Commission to allow for a standard tier rate plan, which is the way it currently charges customers without consideration of the time energy is consumed, in May 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "The utility hopes to offer that plan as “an option for customers who may not be able to make the shifts in electricity usage needed to be successful on a time-based rate plan during summer months,” Evergy said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Evergy wants customers who choose to switch time-based plans to be prevented from switching back to an old plan for at least 12 months, unless they are returning to the default plan.\n",

      "\n",
      "The president spoke at Russia's Eastern Economic Forum on Tuesday, touching on the economic problems that the nation was currently facing. Russian inflation accelerated 5.15% year-over-year in August, well-above the central bank's 4% inflation target. Prices that high make the economic environment extremely uncertain for businesses in the nation, Putin said, per Reuters.\n",

      "\n",
      "Russia's economy is now under pressure to lift interest rates to lower inflation, but keep rates low enough to stimulate the economy and bolster its ruble, which recently slumped to a 16-month-low against the dollar.

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it reduces lending opportunities and slightly restrains the economy … but it is a significant factor for inflation risks,\" Putin said of Russia's monetary tightening efforts. \"If we miss a situation that will lead to uncontrollable inflation growth, in the long run it will be even worse for the economy,\" he later added.\n",

      "Experts and observers say that Russia's economy has been significantly hobbled over the past year by western sanctions and the costly invasion of Ukraine. The nation's oil and gas revenue has plunged since the west imposed sanctions on key energy commodities, and under-the-radar economic indicators suggest that Russia's economy has broadly deteriorated since the start of the war.\n",

American Express is expanding its Centurion Lounge network, announcing that it will open a new lounge at New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in 2026. This will be the third Centurion Lounge to join the tri-state area, joining locations at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA). Inspired by New Jersey's history and culture, the new lounge will offer guests an immersive and relaxing experience with a range of unique features such as live music and a cocktail bar influenced by the 20th-century jazz era. CNBC Select has the scoop on what you can expect from Amex's upcoming Centurion Lounge and how you'll be able to get in.\n",

      "The Newark Centurion Lounge will be in EWR's new Terminal A and clock in at a whopping 17,000 square feet, which is larger than any existing Centurion Lounge. It promises some unique amenities along with a luxurious design that leans towards a more neutral color palette than the typical Centurion Lounge. Jazz bar and piano lounge It's not common to find live music in airports, let alone in an airport lounge, but American Express likes to do things differently. The Newark Centurion Lounge will boast a cocktail bar inspired by New Jersey's 20th-century jazz era, plus a piano lounge featuring live music. Like the 1850 Speakeasy Bar at the JFK Centurion Lounge, American Express is taking a page out of its book by capturing the essence of a bygone urban era. Archival collection Along with the lounge's musical escape, guests will be able to immerse themselves in the archival collection featuring artifacts and antiques that celebrate New Jersey's culture and history of innovation. Indoor terrace Guests will also be able to enjoy sweeping views from a 1,400-square-foot indoor terrace overlooking Newark Airport's airfield and the Manhattan skyline. Locally-inspired food and drinks Like all other Centurion Lounges, guests can expect a hearty menu that incorporates a mix of local and artisanal ingredients. There will also be a staffed bar where bartenders will shake up complimentary craft cocktails. Wi-Fi and other amenities In addition to food and relaxation, guests can expect amenities like private workspaces, a family room, high-speed Wi-Fi, premium restrooms, shower suites and lots of power outlets. More amenities will be announced closer to the lounge's opening.\n",

      "Content: Lufthansa will bring new international competition to Minnesota with the launch of its first-ever service here next summer: A year-round nonstop between Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and Frankfurt, Germany.\n",
      "\n",
      "The German airline will become the 18th — and the first new transcontinental carrier in more than four years — at MSP when it launches the service June 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Lufthansa announcement clearly enhances our credentials as an international destination,\" said Melvin Tennant, president and chief executive of Meet Minneapolis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The addition of the Lufthansa service will help the region's marketers attract international tourists, book conferences and develop stronger business ties, with med tech and clean tech being two key economic sectors that Minnesota and Germany share.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This announcement from Lufthansa is a reinforcement of the fact that Minneapolis-St. Paul is a global hub for business, and more direct connectivity to the heart of Europe will make our economy more competitive for companies seeking to do business in our state,\" said Peter Frosch, chief executive of the Greater MSP economic development group. \"And it creates new options for business and personal travelers in Minnesota.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel demand to Europe is surging after pandemic shutdowns and as the dollar remains strong, with MSP's dominant carrier, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, expanding international service and more competition on the way. Last month, Aer Lingus announced plans to resume flights to Dublin next spring while Delta will add that nonstop route from MSP around the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Lufthansa will have some competition for passengers. In April 2022, German leisure airline Condor restored its nonstop summer service to Frankfurt from MSP for the first time since 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "Metropolitan Airports Commission Chair Rick King believes Lufthansa saw strong demand not only from MSP travelers wanting another European destination but also those needing its connections to Africa and India.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a multi-year effort to get a quality carrier like Lufthansa,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lufthansa Vice President Dirk Janzen said in a statement that these are \"exciting times\" for the airline.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The United States remains our most important market outside of the Group's European home markets, and we could not be happier to open new gateways, offering additional travel opportunities from your region to our global network of destinations,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lufthansa will operate the MSP-FRA route five days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday) with a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, offering a three-class configuration of business, premium economy and economy. Tickets are available beginning Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flight from Frankfurt will depart at 11:10 a.m. and arrive in Minneapolis at 1:15 p.m. The flight departing MSP leaves at 3:15 p.m. and arrives in Frankfurt at 6:40 a.m. the following day. (All times are local.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The early morning arrival for Frankfurt-bound passengers will provide connectivity options to destinations across Lufthansa's global network. For example, demand to East Africa from the Twin Cities is currently the fourth-highest in the United States after Washington, D.C., New York and Chicago.\n",

      "Content: Mayor Mike Duggan divided his attention equally Tuesday, test driving vehicles from each of the Big Three automakers during a tour of the Detroit auto show, but declined to say much on the possibility of a United Auto Workers strike.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mayor said he hopes an agreement is reached because an \"alternative is bad\" for the autoworkers, companies, city and state.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know everybody's trying hard to reach a resolution and I think everybody in town is hoping they do. We'd be far better off if we came up with something where the auto workers were treated fairly in light of the industry's success, but we need GM, Ford and Stellantis to also be successful. Hopefully they'll reach that agreement,\" Duggan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He declined further comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duggan drove a Ford Mustang Mach-E, road down a steep hill in a Jeep Wrangler and took a ride in an autonomous vehicle during a tour of the Detroit auto show, which will open to the public this weekend at Huntington Place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duggan took the wheel and spun for a lap in a Mach-E after touring various exhibits, focusing mainly on the Big Three automakers while gazing at luxury automakers BMW, Lincoln, and passed up on sitting in a Ferrari Monza SP1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duggan sat inside various vehicles, including a 2024 Cadillac Lyriq, GMC Sierra EV but he particularly eyed a silver and black hybrid Jeep Grand Cherokee, produced in the Mack Assembly Plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duggan later took the passenger seat in a red Jeep Wrangler through a display mimicking a roller coaster, where a driver took him up and down a steep hill, and wrapped around the floor, which was an experience the mayor said would be \"a good one to have your seatbelt on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be in a Wrangler where you think the vehicle is about to fall over, but it takes you very smoothly, it's pretty impressive. I don't remember so many different cars,\" Duggan said about the auto show. \"Any kind of car you think you might want to look at, it's going to be here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The mayor wrapped up with a walk through the AutoMobili-D exhibits before a short ride in May Mobility's autonomous vehicle, adding that the company will begin transporting riders in Detroit in the fall of 2024. A safety driver will sit in the driver seat of an autonomous vehicle to start, Duggan added.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The future is arriving soon. In January, they're going to have a contract to start transporting folks around the city of Detroit,\" Duggan said. \"Detroit doesn't like change very much, we'll come along slowly. We're talking about dedicated lanes, of course what we're doing on Michigan Avenue could really pave the way for autonomous vehicles to share the road with regular vehicles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "More:Michigan Avenue may soon become the most advanced road in US\n",
      "\n",
      "Edwin Olson, founder and chief executive officer of May Mobility, said their vehicles contain multiple lidar sensors, radars and camera to track surrounding directions for road users, obstacles, lanes and more. The first year will serve as a testing and data collection period using three vehicles, and the second year will phase in the service, focusing on populations with issues accessing mobility.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Vehicles like these can help connect people to public transit, providing a Lyft or Uber experience,\" Olson said. \"Every time you can prevent a personally-owned car from coming to downtown, you're reducing congestion, reducing pollution, eliminating parking spaces. And that makes it a win for the city.\"\n",

      "Content: COVERT, MI – The company that owns the Palisades nuclear plant announced that it will restart the 800-megawatt power plant in a deal with Wolverine Power Cooperative.\n",
      "\n",
      "The facility stands to become the first decommissioned nuclear plant to be fired back up in the entire United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holtec International said on Tuesday, Sept. 12, that it entered a long-term power purchase agreement with Wolverine, which committed to buy up to two-thirds of the nuclear energy generated at the facility in Covert Township. Rural electric cooperative project partner Hoosier Energy will purchase the balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly Trice, president of Holtec’s nuclear generation and decommissioning, said they are thrilled to be in this new partnership. He said it’s a “significant milestone” toward reopening the plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The repowering of Palisades ensures Michigan has sufficient energy to meet future demand and mitigate the impact of climate change, while creating hundreds of high-paying Michigan jobs, expanding the local tax base, and unleashing economic opportunity within the region and beyond,” Trice said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said with support from federal partners, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the Michigan Legislature, and the local community, this plan “will soon be a reality.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wolverine provides electricity to rural communities across more than half of the Lower Peninsula from 60% carbon-free sources. Co-op officials said this new agreement will bolster their commitment to provide reliable, affordable, and clean power.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The restart of Palisades offers a practical, long-term solution to electric reliability in our state and aligns with Michigan’s ambitious goals to reduce carbon emissions,” said Eric Baker, Wolverine’s top executive officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plant was closed in May last year when its fuel ran out and the owner sold the facility to Holtec. The new owner has now twice applied for federal money to help get the plant operational again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michigan lawmakers included $150 million toward the effort to restart the Palisades nuclear plant as part of a record $81.7 billion state budget recently passed. The application for federal nuclear program dollars remains pending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: Should Michigan have more nuclear power plants? State study underway\n",
      "\n",
      "The planned restart of the shuttered nuclear power plant near South Haven could bolster Michigan’s carbon-free energy supply and help meet emissions reduction goals while awaiting more wind and solar energy generation to come onto the grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Natural gas power plants have provided a greater percentage of the state’s energy supply following the closure of the Palisades nuclear plant and some coal-fired generation, such as the Weadock Plant in Hampton Township and the shutdown of the D.E. Karn Plant in Essexville.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of nuclear energy is part of Michigan’s carbon emissions mitigation plan adopted last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whitmer’s press secretary said they have been proud to support the work to get this done.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Today’s agreement is a strong step toward restarting Palisades, which would save 600 good-paying, high-skill jobs, continue delivering clean power to approximately 800,000 homes, and support an economic engine in Southwest Michigan,” said Stacey LaRouche, Whitmer’s press secretary.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our state is once again leading by example, as Palisades is on track to becoming the first successfully restarted nuclear power plant in American history. We are showing the world that Michigan will be an epicenter of clean energy production and do what it takes to save jobs, protect local communities, and deliver reliable power to homes and small businesses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But not everyone is excited about the announcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some residents of Palisades Park call this among the riskiest and worst environmental decisions ever made in the nuclear power industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The plant was too expensive to keep running due to costly maintenance issues in which the previous owner was not willing to invest, so the aging plant is now in worse condition than it was when it closed,” said Kevin Flynn of Palisades Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "He argued it is short-sighted to re-open a “badly designed, poorly constructed nuclear reactor that sits on the fresh water supply for millions of residents in Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Power generation at nuclear plants does not generate greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change, like burning fossil fuels does. However, some environmental advocates remain concerned about ecological degradation from needed uranium mining and radiation risk from toxic waste nuclear plants produce.\n",

      "TOKYO/SINGAPORE/TAIPEI, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW), which is making an unprecedented push into chip manufacturing overseas, is taking an increasingly optimistic view of Japan as a production base, two industry sources said, as problems persist at its new factory in Arizona.\n",
      "\n",
      "TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is frustrated in Arizona, the sources said, where it has struggled to recruit workers for the gruelling chipmaking trade and faced pushback from unions on efforts to bring in workers from Taiwan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company has growing confidence in Japan, where an $8.6 billion fab under construction in a chipmaking hub on the island of Kyushu is on track to start producing mature-technology chips in 2024, the sources said.\n",
      "\n",
      "While keen to ensure a smooth ramp up at the first fab, the chipmaker is considering adding capacity and a second fab in Japan, the sources said, which could include the production of more advanced chips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several chip industry sources spoke to Reuters about TSMC's view of Japan and its global expansion on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Successful expansion by TSMC in Japan could give a boost to efforts by the country to regain its lost status as a chip manufacturing powerhouse and support its automotive and electronics industries amid growing regional competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "TSMC said in a statement its overseas expansion depends on factors including the needs of customers, the level of government support and cost considerations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Arizona, TSMC plans to produce advanced chips but a shortage of skilled workers has forced the company to push back production at its first fab by a year to 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any project... will have some learning curve. In the past five months the improvement has been tremendous,\" TSMC Chairman Mark Liu said of the Arizona project last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fabs in the U.S., Japan and Germany, where it is also expanding, are \"inherently incomparable\" due to differences in location, setup and scope, TSMC said.\n",
      "\n",
      "NATURAL FIT\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S., Japan and Germany have offered TSMC billions of dollars in subsidies for it to localise production in efforts to diversify the supply of chips, which are essential to the defence, automotive and electronics industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $40 billion investment in Arizona allows TSMC to add capacity outside Taiwan, where it faces constraints on land, power, water and labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the company views Japan as a more natural fit in terms of work culture, and its government is easy to deal with and generous with subsidies, the sources said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The relationship between TSMC and the Japanese government is mutually beneficial,\" said Lucy Chen, an analyst at Isaiah Research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Japan's advantages for the chipmaker include its network of chip equipment and materials suppliers, similarities in work culture and proximity to Taiwan, she added.\n",
      "\n",
      "TSMC sees workers in Japan, which is known for long hours and strong commitment to employers, as more willing to work a punishing schedule with overtime as chipmaking machines run around the clock in sterile clean rooms, the sources said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A lot of machines cannot be shut down because it costs TSMC to recalibrate on rebooting,\" said a chip industry executive.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is only a two-hour flight to Kyushu, where TSMC is partnering with companies including Sony (6758.T), a leading maker of image sensors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taiwanese workers arriving to help set up the fab are welcome, and the chipmaker will pay higher wages to secure local employees as it competes with rivals such as foundry venture Rapidus, the sources said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It seems to us that TSMC is really positive about investment in Japan,\" said a senior official at the powerful Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), which has offered subsidies worth up to 476 billion yen ($3.23 billion) for the first fab.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will really welcome the second fab project in general but we have to see the detail first,\" the official said.\n",
      "\n",
      "While many equipment and materials makers already have global operations, to meet its exacting standards TSMC has also brought suppliers to Japan from Taiwan, the sources said.\n",
      "\n",
      "RISING CAPITAL SPENDING\n",
      "\n",
      "TSMC's enthusiasm for Japan is being tempered by concerns about higher costs across the business and worries about the macro environment, the sources said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Capital expenditure ballooned to $36 billion last year from $10 billion in 2018, with the company forecasting a slightly smaller outflow this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "TSMC thought costs to build a fab would be 20% higher in the U.S. than in Taiwan but they are actually about 50% higher, an investor briefed by company management said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chipmaker plans to build an $11 billion fab in Germany with local firms but is also concerned the work culture there, with long vacations and strong unions, will hit output, the sources said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors worry about the effect of higher costs but \"the impact on TSMC today has not been that big because its leading technology gives it pricing power,\" said Brady Wang, an analyst at research firm Counterpoint.\n",

      "Content: We apply the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM), a partial equilibrium economic model that integrates global agricultural, bioenergy, and forestry sectors43,44 (Supplementary notes 9). The model is solved in a recursive dynamic manner in 10-year time steps from 2000 to 2050. Following McCarl and Spreen83, market equilibrium is computed by allocating resources to production and processing activities while maximizing welfare (the sum of consumer and producer surpluses) subject to technological, resource, demand, and policy constraints84. Prices are calculated endogenously to balance supply, demand, and trade for each product and region. Agricultural policies are taken into account implicitly through adjustment of agricultural costs to reflect subsidies so that the marginal costs equal marginal benefits, as assumed by microeconomic theory. The policies are then assumed constant over the simulation horizon. Any change in the policies, such as in the subsidy levels, would cause a shift in profitability of the agricultural activities and would lead to a new equilibrium state, with new levels of supply, demand and prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food demand projections are based on the interaction of three different drivers: population growth, income per capita growth, response to prices. Population growth and income per capita growth are exogenously introduced in the model reference scenario. Price effect is endogenously computed, and the final demand in the model is therefore influence by some other assumptions on technology, natural resources, etc. that shape price patterns. Commodity markets and international trade are modeled at the level of 37 aggregate economic regions (Supplementary notes 7). The model’s crop sector includes 18 major crops, and its production parameters are based on the biophysical crop model EPIC85. The livestock sector covers 7 major animal products, and it includes the representation of different International Livestock Research Institute/FAO production systems, agroecological zones, animal types, and management systems based on Herrero et al.65. The modeling of land use explicitly accounts for market dynamics related to scenario features, including both direct land use changes (e.g., domestic increases in the area of a crop in response a domestic demand increase) and indirect land use changes (e.g., within country re-allocations between crops and crop management systems, as well as changes in cropland allocation in other regions as mediated through trade).\n",

      "GLOBIOM covers major greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) based on IPCC accounting guidelines including N 2 O from application of fertilizer and manure to soils, N 2 O from manure dropped on pastures, CH 4 from rice cultivation, N 2 O and CH 4 from manure management, and CH 4 from enteric fermentation, and CO 2 emissions/removals from above- and below-ground biomass changes for other natural vegetation. In the nitrogen flows presented in this study (Figs. 3 and 4) we follow Chang et al. 53. in estimating total nitrogen crop inputs (based on harvested crop nitrogen and nitrogen use efficiency) and manure nitrogen application (based on livestock excretion and manure management efficiency).\n",

      "The forestry sector is represented by the biophysical Global Forest Model (G4M)86,87. G4M model provides the minimum and maximum constraint for the area of abandoned cropland and pastureland that can be afforested. Minimum afforestation is based on reference scenario projections at the regional level; maximum afforestation potential is based on suitability in terms of net primary productivity, at the pixel level. The estimate of the amount of carbon captured is based on the G4M model while the time dynamics of carbon density growth curves, differentiated by climate regions, are based on Humpenöder et al.88. The afforestation is modeled to take place with locally naturally occurring tree species. This allows us to assume improvements in biodiversity consistent with restoration of forest ecosystems. It might be possible to further increase biomass growth and carbon sequestration in certain areas with fast-growing plantations of energy grasses or fast-growing non-native tree species; however, this would have negative implications for biodiversity, besides being dependent on additional carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. Biodiversity benefits could be potentially even higher if restoration would happen into non-forest ecosystems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The afforestation is introduced in forest ecosystems, as constrained by gridded forest mask from the LUH289 dataset and afforestation potentials from the G4M model86. This allows us to avoid negative impacts of tree restoration on other natural ecosystems explored in some previous studies. Bastin et al.61. estimated that global tree restoration potential is about 900 Mha if current agricultural and urban areas are excluded. This study received a lot of attention and created a debate on the trade-offs of tree restoration benefits since majority of the restoration potential was located in natural land such as savanna where it would displace other valuable ecosystems62,63.\n",

      "Prevalence of undernourishment is calculated using three key factors: the mean dietary energy availability (kcal per person per day), the mean minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER) and the coefficient of variation of the domestic distribution of dietary energy availability in a country90. The food distribution in a country is assumed to obey a log-normal distribution, which is determined by the mean food calorie availability and the equity of the food distribution. The proportion of the population under the cut-off point (MDER) is then defined as the prevalence of under-nourishment. The calorie-based food consumption (kcal per person per day) output from the model is used for the mean food calorie availability. The future mean MDER is calculated for each year and country using the mean MDER in the base year at the country, adjusted for the MDER in different age and sex groups and future population demographics to reflect differences in the MDER across age and sex. The future equity of food distribution is estimated by applying the historical trend of income growth and the improved coefficient of variation of the food distribution to the future, such that the equity is improved along with income growth in future at historical rates up to the present best value (0.2). No risk of hunger for high-income countries where hunger is not currently reported is assumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Estimates of the intactness of local ecological communities are based on the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII)91, which measures the local compositional intactness of local communities as impacted by land use, relative to if the region were still covered with primary vegetation and facing minimal human pressures. To estimate the BII corresponding to the land use projected by GLOBIOM, we used the BII model derived from the PREDICTS database92 as implemented in Leclère et al. 22, and complemented by an explicit accounting of the temporal dynamics of BII recovery under restoration actions based on Poorter et al. 93.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the reference scenario (REF), trajectories of socioeconomic variables, income, and population, are based on the SSP2 ‘middle-of-the-road’ development in the mitigation and adaptation challenges space94. It constitutes REF scenario because it assumes that the world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns, with continuation of uneven development and income growth with persistent or slightly improving inequalities45. Throughout the analysis, we assume the current (historical) climate and don’t apply any exogenous climate-specific shocks on crop yield, grassland yield, or animal productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We compare the REF scenario results with the results of a suite of alternative ASF substitution scenarios developed specifically for this work. We implemented the substitution by exogenously reducing the food consumption of ASF products by a percentage of the consumption projected in the REF scenario. The reduction starts in the year 2030 and it is applied gradually to be completed (achieve the maximum level) by the year 2050. Simultaneously to the reduction in ASF consumption, we model an equivalent increase in the production and consumption of the corresponding novel alternatives. As a result, the total consumption of each ASF product and its novel alternative is always equal to the REF ASF consumption of that product. This assumes that the novel alternatives will substitute the ASF products at a ‘one to one’ substitution rate. The production of the novel alternatives is modeled as a process that requires crop feed inputs based on pre-defined recipes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each scenario is characterized by six elements: the substitution rate, the region where the substitution is applied, the ASF product being substituted, the recipe being used to produce the novel alternatives, the assumption on the sourcing of recipe crop ingredients, and the assumption on crop processing and the accounting of by-products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four different levels of substitution were analyzed, corresponding to 10, 25, 50, and 90% ASF substitution by 2050.\n",
      "\n",
      "We implemented the substitution globally or alternatively only within one of 13 macro regions (single-region scenarios): Brazil, China, Former Soviet Union, India, Middle East and North Africa, Other Asia, Other South America, Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, Canada, Europe, United States. A mapping of GLOBIOM model regions into the 13 macro regions can be found in the supplementary material. In a single-region scenario, the dietary change is implemented in one region, while the rest of the world has the same diet as in REF. This setting allows for studying, among others, impacts of changes in demand in one region on consumption in other regions and the net impact of these changes on the studied outcomes. It is expected that lower demand in one region will lead to lower prices, which are transmitted through markets to other regions. Due to lower prices, consumption in the rest of the world might increase, resulting in the net smaller decrease in global consumption and smaller benefits to the environment and other objectives. This outcome is referred to as a rebound effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "In each scenario, either a single ASF product (beef, chicken, pork, or milk) is substituted individually or all ASF products are substituted simultaneously. There are five alternative recipes for beef and two alternative recipes for each of the other ASF products (Table 1). In the single product scenarios, the recipe is selected exogenously and scenarios for each recipe were analyzed. In the scenario where all ASF products are substituted simultaneously, all recipes are permissible, and one is selected endogenously by the model based on the least cost of crop ingredients in the given GLOBIOM model economic region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Table 1 Composition of recipes Full size table\n",
      "\n",
      "Recipe development sought to balance global and regional abundance, efficiency, nutritional quality, and functional role of crop-derived ingredients in dietary replacement of livestock analogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three primary categories were identified as delivering requisite functional attributes of recapitulating meat using crop-derived ingredients: proteins, binders (carbohydrates), and oils. All GLOBIOM crops were assessed against these categories as potential ingredient sources, ranked as high-, medium-, and low-potential and only the medium- and high-potential crops were retained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensuring that the macro- and micro-nutrient profile, as well as protein quality, was consistent with that of the animal analog, we began with a high or medium protein source, and we calculated the amount (in %) of the crop required to reach approximate parity with the animal product being replaced. Next, a high/medium fat source was selected and the % use was calculated, again to meet parity with the animal analogue. Assuming that water would make up approx. 50–60% of meat recipes and approx. 90% of milk recipes, a high/medium carbohydrate crop was selected to make up the remainder of the recipe. If the carbohydrate source also contributed significant protein or fat, the % uses of the other protein and/or fat ingredients were adjusted to ensure that the total macronutrient contents of the recipes matched those of their animal analogs. Next, to ensure that protein quality was not sacrificed, total amino acid content for each recipe was calculated to determine its Amino Acid Score (AAS). The goal was for the AAS to match or exceed that of the animal analogue by achieving as close to a score of 1.0 (truncated) as possible. For reference, the AAS for beef is 0.9495. These protein quality scores were not corrected for digestibility in this exercise. However, all recipes achieved an AAS between 0.9 and 1.0, except for the M2 milk recipe, for which the ability to supplement with additional amino acids was assumed. Table 1 below shows the composition of the recipes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of the recipes calls for the inclusion of a vegetable oil. Six different oil crops are represented in the GLOBIOM model (soybean, rapeseed, sunflower, palm, groundnut, and cottonseed) and the respective oils were considered to be functionally equivalent for the purposes of recipe composition. For simplification, we exogenously assigned one vegetable oil in each of the 37 GLOBIOM model regions, and the choice of the vegetable oil varies between scenarios of global vs. local sourcing of novel alternatives crop ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our recipes allow for the use of more diverse ingredients and are largely agnostic to current recipes on the market, in favor or hypothetical and realistic recipes that could be sourced, manufactured, and scaled globally. One or more modeled recipes are similar to the Impossible Burger and Beyond Burgers which are available in LCA studies96,97, because the ingredients met the criteria nutritionally, functionally, and are within the GLOBIOM crop inventory.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the global sourcing scenarios, we identified the most abundant oil in each market (whether or not produced locally, imported, or produced from imported crops) using statistics for the latest available year98,99. For the local sourcing scenarios, in each market we assigned the most abundant oil produced from locally grown crops, again based on latest available statistics. Table S18 (Supplementary notes 8) in the supplementary material shows the vegetable oil choice in each region and scenario setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, in the locally sourced scenarios, imports are capped at a level equivalent to the level of imports in the REF scenario. This is to simulate the reliance on locally produced inputs into the production of novel alternatives. The import cap is effective on the outside border of the 13 macro regions; trade within those regions in not restricted. In the global sourcing scenarios, no changes or restrictions are applied to the reference scenario trade conditions and quantities. We do not consider trade with the final products of the novel alternatives, which would include all the additional costs, such as labor, and could potentially change the trade flows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The novel alternatives recipes were constructed using processed ingredients such as flours and protein concentrates. In contrast, the GLOBIOM model generally follows the convention used by FAOSTAT and operates with quantities of primary crop equivalents. It was therefore necessary to convert the recipe ingredients into the corresponding primary crop equivalents. The supplementary material shows a detailed description of the processing conversions and yields of processed products and by-products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Different assumptions that can be taken about the fate and potential utilization of the by-products of the conversion of primary crops into processed recipe ingredients give rise to two alternative sets of (processing) scenarios (Supplementary notes 4): inefficient and efficient. In the so-called inefficient scenarios, we assume that none of the processing by-products will find a use in the global food system and we therefore account for the entire amount of the primary commodity which is required to produce a given amount of the processed ingredient. In the efficient scenarios, we assume that all the processing by-products will find a use in the global food system; we therefore account for only the amount of the primary commodity corresponding to the weight of the processed ingredient.\n",
      "\n",
      "We present these alternative approaches as an envelope of possible outcomes; depending on the specific ingredient, by-product, and crop, either the efficient or the inefficient assumption might be closer to reality. Today, several ingredients found in novel alternative recipes are byproducts from grain and protein processing, indicating that some degree of efficiency is likely, whether monetization of coproducts follows or is preceded by the ingredient’s use in novel alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our analysis does not consider the production costs of novel alternatives other than the costs of the crop ingredients mentioned earlier. Production costs would shape prices of the novel alternatives and hence decide about the level their adoption. We impose exogenously the level of production and consumption of novel alternatives and the substitution of ASFs is not affected by the relative prices of animal products and alternatives. We can expect that over time with scale and technological advances, the production costs of the novel alternatives would decrease and that product quality would increase - in line with the assumption of the increasing substitution over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recipes were constructed to match the nutritional profile of typical animal product commodities; however, the nutritional profile of animal products varies regionally. In our analysis, we assume that the novel alternatives have the same regionally differentiated calorie content as the animal products they replace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides meat and milk, the livestock sector also supplies animal fats for human consumption totaling approx. 14 million tonnes globally98. In the analysis presented here, we do not account for this quantity of animal products which would presumably need to be substituted with vegetable oils should a large-scale reduction in animal herds take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, GLOBIOM is a partial equilibrium (PE) model, which means that the relevant sectors (agriculture, forestry and bioenergy) are represented in detail, however other economic sectors are not included, or only represented through an external variable (e.g. price of fertilizer). GLOBIOM assumes that the economy outside land use sectors evolves independently from the policies assessed in the model, following a ceteris paribus approach.\n",

       "'Some residents stranded in Southern California mountain communities by a huge snowfall could be stuck for another week, an official said Friday.\\n\\nA late-February blast of arctic air produced a rare blizzard east of Los Angeles in the San Bernardino Mountains, where thousands of people live at high elevations in forest communities or visit for year-round recreation.\\n\\nExtraordinary snowfall buried homes and businesses, overwhelming the capability of snowplowing equipment geared toward ordinary storms.\\n\\nBy last weekend, all highways leading up into the mountains were closed and have opened intermittently since then to residents and convoys of trucks loaded with food or other supplies.\\n\\nThe estimate by San Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus was an improvement in the outlook for stranded residents, which previously ranged up to two weeks.\\n\\n“We’ve said we could push it out as far as two weeks but because of the state’s efforts and the equipment that’s coming in behind us we’re hoping to drop that down to a week,” he told a press conference.\\n\\nThe sheriff and other officials said progress has been made, but they described severe conditions that, for example, have forced firefighters to reach emergency scenes such as fires in snowcats.\\n\\n“The enormity of this event is hard to comprehend,” said state Assemblyman Tom Lackey. “You know, we’re thinking, ‘We’re in Southern California,’ but yet we have had an inundation that has really, really generated a severe amount of anxiety, frustration and difficulty, especially to the victims and those who are actually trapped in their own home.”\\n\\nSan Bernardino County is one of 13 counties where California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared states of emergency due to the impacts of severe weather, including massive snowfalls that have collapsed roofs due to too much weight.\\n\\nIn the northern part of the state, mountain communities grappling with the conditions have smaller populations and are more accustomed to significant snowfall.\\n\\nResidents and vacationers trapped in the San Bernardino range have taken to social media to show their plight and wonder when plows are coming.\\n\\nShelah Riggs said the street she lives on in Crestline hasn’t seen a snowplow in eight days, leaving people in about 80 homes along the roadway with nowhere to go. Typically, a plow comes every day or two when it snows, she said.\\n\\n“We are covered with five or six feet (1.5 or 1.8 meters); nobody can get out of their driveways at all,” she said in a telephone interview.\\n\\nRiggs, who lives with her 14-year-old daughter, said everyone is working to keep snow and ice off their decks to prevent collapse and making sure the gas vents on their homes are kept clear.\\n\\nShe said the county’s response has been “horrible” and that “people are really angry.”\\n\\nDevine Horvath, also of Crestline, said it took her and her son 30 minutes to walk down the street to check on a neighbor — a trek that normally takes just a few minutes.\\n\\nHorvath said she was lucky to make it to the local grocery store before its roof collapsed several days earlier but hadn’t been able to leave her street since.\\n\\n“I’m getting more upset by the day,” she said.\\n\\nThe sheriff sought to give reassurance that help is coming even if people haven’t seen any plows.\\n\\n“We’re going to dig you out and we are coming,” Dicus said. “We are making tremendous progress. I saw this from the air yesterday. The roads are being cleared.”\\n\\nOfficials said crews were dealing with such tremendous depths of snow that removal required front-end loaders and dump trucks rather than regular plows.\\n\\nCalifornia Department of Transportation official Jim Rogers said crews working 24-hour shifts have removed more than 2.6 million cubic yards (1.9 million cubic meters) of snow from state highways.\\n\\nOfficials described a host of difficulties in reopening smaller roads, including buried vehicles and downed power lines that make progress difficult. Residents were urged to somehow mark the locations of cars.\\n\\nA reopened road may only be the width of a single vehicle with walls of ice on each side.\\n\\n“We are going house to house, and we’re literally using shovels to shovel out driveways to make sure that people have access to their cars,” said county fire Chief Dan Munsey. “As the roads are plowed, you still have a 10-foot (3-meter) berm of snow that you need to make it over.”\\n\\nMore snowcats were being brought in, along with a California National Guard crew that normally works with the California Wildfire & Forest Resilience Task Force on wildfires. The crew will help shovel snow.\\n\\nWhile more heavy snow was forecast to arrive in Northern California early Saturday, Southern California was expected to remain storm-free except for possible light rain.\\n\\n“The weather looks great for the next seven days, and that’s great news,” Munsey said.\\n\\nAbout 80,000 people live in the San Bernardino Mountains either part or full time. The county has not estimated how many people are currently in the mountains because many residences are vacation homes or rentals.'"

May is a political heavyweight and is generally respected among the Tories, something Boris Johnson is … um, not.\\n\\nNigel Farage – the once-embattled UK Independence Party leader gets his moment in the sun. Also gets to keep having a political career. And the fact that he quoted \"Independence Day\" in his victory speech made a crazy night that much crazier.\\n\\nMarine Le Pen/Geert Wilders – Charismatic figures with a long history agitating for EU exits, France\\'s Marine Le Pen and the Netherlands\\' Geert Wilders wasted no time calling for their own referendums. Brexit legitimizes their years of saber-rattling, and moves them from the political fringes into the mainstream, where they can do serious damage to the European project.\\n\\nVladimir Putin – Russia\\'s strongman needed this. Low oil prices have leveled the Russian economy, and the International Olympic Committee has banned Russian track athletes from competing at \\u202a#\\u200eRio2016\\u202c. But now he gets to say \"at least we\\'re not Europe.\"\\n\\nNicola Sturgeon – The head of the Scottish National Party delivered on her end from Scotland, where 62 percent of Scots voted to \"Remain,\" though turnout wasn\\'t as high as hoped. She now has political leverage by threatening to hold another Scottish referendum. And if Scotland leaves, the British drought at Wimbledon gets retroactively reinstated.\\n\\nGerman/US relations – Going to get stronger. By default.'"
