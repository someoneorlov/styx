Here are the companies trying to enter the booming space\", \"text\": \"In this article VKTX Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\\\\n\\\\nStill life of Wegovy an injectable prescription weight loss medicine that has helped people with obesity. It should be used with a weight loss plan and physical activity. Michael Siluk | UCG | Getty Images\\\\n\\\\nBoehringer Ingelheim\\\\n\\\\nBoehringer Ingelheim is developing a weight loss drug with Danish biotech firm Zealand Pharma. That company has been working on obesity treatments for nearly a decade. Their experimental drug works by targeting two gut hormones: GLP-1 to suppress appetite, and glucagon to increase energy expenditure. Some popular weight loss drugs such as Novo Nordisk\\'s Wegovy only target GLP-1. Boehringer Ingelheim in August said it was moving the drug, called survodutide, into a late-stage study, bringing it one step closer to potential Food and Drug Administration approval. A mid-stage trial found patients who are overweight or have obesity lost up to 19% of their weight after 46 weeks of treatment with the drug. That weight loss could be closer to 20% to 25% in a phase three trial, Zealand Pharma said ahead of the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference last week. It\\'s unclear when that product could win approval.\\\\n\\\\nTerns Pharmaceuticals\\\\n\\\\nSmaller drugmakers are developing their own weight loss drugs. They could eventually enter the market through a buyout or partnerships with large pharmaceutical companies. Those companies include Terns Pharmaceuticals, which is much earlier in the development process than Boehringer Ingelheim is. The company is conducting an early-stage trial examining its oral weight loss drug, which works by targeting GLP-1, in patients who are overweight or obese. Oral drugs will likely be easier for patients to take and for companies to manufacture compared to the existing weight loss injections. Terns Pharmaceuticals expects to release initial 28-day data from that trial in the second half of 2024, the company\\'s head of research and development, Erin Quirk, said during the conference. Quirk acknowledged that it may be difficult for Terns to set its pill apart from other weight loss drugs. But she added that \\\\\"even if it\\'s not the best\\\\u2026analysts are out there predicting that this could be $100 billion market. If you get a 1% piece of that, that\\'s a $1 billion drug, right?\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSmall biotech companies make moves\\\\n\\\\nOther small drugmakers trying to enter the space include Viking Therapeutics, which is developing drugs that target GLP-1 and another hormone called GIP. Those are the same hormones that Eli Lilly\\'s weight loss and diabetes drugs, Zepbound and Mounjaro, target. Viking Therapeutics expects to release mid-stage trial data on its weight loss injection in the first half of the year. An early-stage study on that drug showed that it caused up to 7.8% weight loss after 28 days. The company is also slated to release phase one trial data on an oral version of its weight loss drug during the first quarter of the year. Structure Therapeutics is similarly developing an obesity pill, which missed Wall Street\\'s expectations for weight loss in a mid-stage trial last month. The oral drug helped obese patients lose roughly 5% of their weight compared to patients who received a placebo after eight weeks. Before that data was published, Jefferies analyst Roger Song had said he was expecting 6% to 7% weight loss relative to a placebo. Structure said it expects full 12-week results on patients with obesity in the second quarter of this year. The company plans to launch a larger mid-stage study in the second half of 2024 and a late-stage trial in 2026.\\\\n\\\\nPotential players down the line\"}, {\"id\": 11890, \"title\": \"Nio stock price forecast: analysis as it breaks key support\", \"text\": \"Nio (NYSE: NIO) stock price is in its third consecutive week in the red as concerns about the EV industry continued.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content\\'s credibility:\\\\n\\\\nA solar-pollinator habitat, dominated by purple prairie clover and black-eyed susan flowering plants. Credit: Argonne National Laboratory/Lee Walston\\\\n\\\\nBumblebees buzz from flower to flower, stopping for a moment under a clear blue Minnesota sky. Birds chirp, and tall grasses blow in the breeze. This isn\\'t a scene from a pristine nature preserve or national park. It is nestled between photovoltaic (PV) solar arrays on rehabilitated farmland.\\\\n\\\\nResearchers at the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory and National Renewable Energy Laboratory wanted to understand the ecological value of PV solar energy sites planted with native grasses and wildflowers. They examined how vegetation would establish and how insect communities would respond to the newly established habitat. The five-year field study published in Environmental Research Letters looked at two solar sites in southern Minnesota operated by Enel Green Power North America. Both sites were built on retired agricultural land.\\\\n\\\\nSmart land use choices provide multiple benefits\\\\n\\\\nGlobal insect biodiversity has been in decline due to habitat loss, pesticides and climate change. Restoration of insect habitat paired with smart land use changes toward renewable energy developments could help reverse the course.\\\\n\\\\nFor instance, as a carbon-neutral source of electricity, expanded PV solar energy development is critical to mitigating climate change. According to the DOE\\'s Solar Futures Study, approximately 10 million acres of land in the U.S. will be needed for large-scale solar development by 2050 in order to meet grid decarbonization and climate change goals. But some lands are better suited for PV solar development than others. Disturbed lands such as former agricultural fields are ideal locations to hold rows of solar panels compared to lands that have been previously undisturbed.\\\\n\\\\nEven more strategies can be added to this winning combination to support insect conservation. Agrivoltaics is the combination of solar energy production with agricultural and vegetation management practices. One type of agrivoltaics focuses on the establishment of habitat for insect pollinators and other wildlife that can provide important ecosystem services, such as pollination.\\\\n\\\\nPairing solar energy facilities on previously disturbed lands with habitat enhancement sounds like a logical win-win strategy to address energy and biodiversity challenges. To date, however, there has been little field data available to document the feasibility and the ecological benefits of this novel land use approach.\\\\n\\\\nAn Argonne scientist surveys for pollinators at a utility-scale solar facility. Credit: Argonne National Laboratory/Lee Walston\\\\n\\\\nIf you build it, will they come?\\\\n\\\\nThe two studied solar sites were planted with native grasses and flowering plants in early 2018. From August 2018 through August 2022, the researchers conducted 358 observational surveys for flowering vegetation and insect communities. They evaluated changes in plant and insect abundance and diversity with each visit.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The effort to obtain these data was considerable, returning to each site four times per summer to record pollinator counts,\\\\\" said Heidi Hartmann, manager of the Land Resources and Energy Policy Program in Argonne\\'s Environmental Sciences division, and one of the study\\'s co-authors. \\\\\"Over time we saw the numbers and types of flowering plants increase as the habitat matured. Measuring the corresponding positive impact for pollinators was very gratifying.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nBy the end of the field campaign, the team had observed increases for all habitat and biodiversity metrics. There was an increase in native plant species diversity and flower abundance. In addition, the team observed increases in the abundance and diversity of native insect pollinators and agriculturally beneficial insects, which included honeybees, native bees, wasps, hornets, hoverflies, other flies, moths, butterflies and beetles.\\\\n\\\\nFlowers and flowering plant species increased as well. Total insect abundance tripled, while native bees showed a 20-fold increase in numbers. The most numerous insect groups observed were beetles, flies and moths.\\\\n\\\\nIn an added benefit, the researchers found that pollinators from the solar sites also visited soybean flowers in adjacent crop fields, providing additional pollination services.\\\\n\\\\nA monarch caterpillar on a common milkweed leaf. Credit: Argonne National Laboratory/Lee Walston\\\\n\\\\nThe benefits of solar-pollinator habitats\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"This research highlights the relatively rapid insect community responses to habitat restoration at solar energy sites,\\\\\" said Lee Walston, an Argonne landscape ecologist and environmental scientist who was lead author of the study. \\\\\"It demonstrates, if properly sited, habitat-friendly solar energy can be a feasible way to safeguard insect populations and can improve the pollination services in adjacent agricultural fields.\\\\\" Walston also serves as head of the Ecology, Natural Resources, and Managed Systems department in Argonne\\'s Environmental Science division.\\\\n\\\\nThe research findings suggest two important implications of habitat-friendly solar energy. One is that habitat-friendly solar sites can play an important role in conserving biodiversity. Large amounts of ground-mounted solar is expected to be developed in the future, but if properly sited, habitat-friendly solar can offset the losses of natural areas to provide biodiversity benefits.\\\\n\\\\nSecond, habitat-friendly solar sites can help mitigate land-use conflicts associated with the conversion of farmland for solar energy production. As approximately 80% of future ground-mounted solar development could occur on agricultural lands, the proper siting of habitat-friendly solar energy on marginal farmland can not only preserve prime farmland, but it could make prime farmland more productive through the pollination services provided by habitat-friendly solar energy.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, additional research is needed to understand the feasibility of habitat-friendly solar across different regions and to meet different ecological goals such as conserving a target insect or wildlife species.\\\\n\\\\nMore information: Leroy J Walston et al, If you build it, will they come?

Though Apple had largely won the case, as the court decided it was not a monopolist, a judge ruled that app makers should be able to steer their customers to the web from links or buttons inside their apps, something that forced Apple to change its App Store rules.\\\\n\\\\nBut Apple\\\\u2019s compliance doesn\\\\u2019t give app makers the victory they had hoped, as the tech giant aims to still charge commissions on purchases made outside of apps \\\\u2014 a decision Epic aims to challenge in court.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to statements made by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, shared on X, Apple\\\\u2019s \\\\u201cbad-faith\\\\u201d compliance undermines the judge\\\\u2019s order that would have allowed buttons or external links \\\\u201cin addition to [in-app purchases].\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThe Ninth Circuit District Court had ruled on one count of out 10 in favor of Epic in its decision, finding that Apple violated California\\\\u2019s Unfair Competition law. The decision meant Apple had to remove the \\\\u201canti-steering\\\\u201d clause from its agreement with App Store developers. This clause for years had prevented app developers from directing their customers to other ways to pay for in-app purchases or subscriptions from inside their apps, leading to confusing screens or broken features, where customers would have to figure out on their own how to make the necessary purchases from the developer\\\\u2019s website.\\\\n\\\\nApple updated its App Store Guidelines following the Supreme Court\\\\u2019s decision but with a lot of caveats. It said that developers would still have to pay a 27% cut on purchases, instead of 30%, and developers in Apple\\\\u2019s Small Business Program or auto-renewing subscriptions in their second year would be reduced to 12%, instead of 15%. This three percentage point discount is similar to what Google is offering through its User Choice billing pilot program, which counts Spotify and Bumble among its early adopters. In Google\\\\u2019s case, it reduced the required commissions by 4%. But these small discounts aren\\\\u2019t enough to make alternative payment processing worthwhile for most developers who have to pay at least that much in payment processing fees, many have argued.\\\\n\\\\nSweeney agrees, noting in his post today, shared on X, that developers aren\\\\u2019t able to offer their digital items \\\\u201cmore cheaply on the web after paying a third-party payment processor 3-6% and paying this new 27% Apple Tax.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nApple filed a bad-faith \\\\u201ccompliance\\\\u201d plan for the District Court\\\\u2019s injunction.

A consumer may easily misunderstand the consequences of canceling and it may be imperative that they learn about better options,\\\\\" NCTA CEO Michael Powell said at the hearing. For example, a customer \\\\\"may face difficulty and unintended consequences if they want to cancel only one service in the package,\\\\\" as \\\\\"canceling part of a discounted bundle may increase the price for remaining services.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nPowell said that cable company reps can usually talk customers out of canceling. \\\\\"Out of millions of cancellations, complaints received by NCTA members amount to only a tiny fraction of 1 percent,\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"Three out of four of the cable and broadband customers who called to cancel end up retaining some or all service after speaking with an agent.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nPowell worries that retaining customers will become tougher because, he said, the FTC \\\\\"proposal prevents almost any communication without first obtaining a consumer\\'s unambiguous, affirmative consent. That could disrupt the continuity of important services, choke off helpful information and forgo potential savings. It certainly raises First Amendment issues.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nPowell also said the cost of complying\\\\u2014including retraining employees and maintaining records for longer than current practice\\\\u2014could force cable companies to raise prices. He claimed that the FTC\\'s estimate of compliance costs is too low.\\\\n\\\\nFTC: Sellers must take \\\\u201cno\\\\u201d for an answer\\\\n\\\\nThe FTC said one of its proposed rules \\\\\"would require businesses to make it at least as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to start it. For example, if you can sign up online, you must be able to cancel on the same website, in the same number of steps.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSellers would also have to obtain customer consent before they \\\\\"pitch additional offers or modifications when a consumer tries to cancel their enrollment,\\\\\" the FTC said. Before making those pitches, sellers would have to \\\\\"ask consumers whether they want to hear them. In other words, a seller must take \\'no\\' for an answer and upon hearing \\'no\\' must immediately implement the cancellation process.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe FTC also proposes that sellers be required to \\\\\"provide an annual reminder to consumers enrolled in negative option programs involving anything other than physical goods, before they are automatically renewed.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAt yesterday\\'s hearing, the FTC also heard from the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), a lobby group for the online advertising industry. \\\\\"The proposed rule would disrupt the current regime by adding specific requirements dictating what auto-renewal disclosures must say and how they must be presented,\\\\\" said Lartease Tiffith, the IAB\\'s executive VP for public policy.\\\\n\\\\nTiffith argued that the rule will burden businesses \\\\\"and restrict innovation without any corresponding benefit. And as the technology develops, these prescriptive requirements will constrain companies from being able to adapt their offerings to the needs of their customers.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nTiffith defended auto-renewals generally, saying the practice of automatically renewing services brings \\\\\"significant benefits to both businesses and consumers in the form of cost savings, convenience, and heightened value.\\\\\"\"}, {\"id\": 11895, \"title\": \"Former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg to leave board amid AI boom\", \"text\": \"Listen 2 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save\\\\n\\\\nFormer Meta chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg is leaving the company\\\\u2019s board of directors after 12 years, marking the end of her leadership of the transformative \\\\u2014 and often controversial \\\\u2014 social media giant.

Coinbase\\\\u2019s attorneys, however, challenged the argument, claiming that Bitcoin \\\\u2014 described as a commodity by an SEC attorney during the hearing \\\\u2014 is also backed by a community and has a network.\\\\n\\\\nJudge Failla delved into the definition of staking and secondary market transactions, as well as recent court rulings involving crypto firms, such as the Ripple and Terraform Labs case. Cointelegraph has summarized the hearing\\\\u2019s hottest topics below.\\\\n\\\\nCoinbase is trying to create a different Howey test, says SEC\\\\n\\\\nAttorneys representing the SEC argued that the exchange is trying to create a different version of the Howey test while allowing trade of crypto tokens that offer holders access to ecosystems that the regulator described as a \\\\\"common enterprise.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe SEC argued that the exchange independently conducted the Howey test, leading to differing interpretations regarding the status of certain tokens. This discrepancy in conclusions over the tokens regarding the test, according to the SEC, provides sufficient grounds to reject the motion and allow the case to proceed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cWe think they\\\\u2019re making up a new test, and we believe that our position is the one that\\\\u2019s most faithful and consistent, but in fact, compelled by the Howey test. It\\\\u2019s not just a plausible reading, as they claim it is.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nSEC v @coinbase Update IV\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn an unusual move, the Judge dispensed with any prepared arguments from either side and instead went straight to questioning the lawyers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe first 2 hours was spent exclusively questioning of the SEC lawyers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe SEC lawyers were better prepared\\\\u2026 \\\\u2014 MetaLawMan (@MetaLawMan) January 17, 2024\\\\n\\\\nTerraform Labs case enters the stage\\\\n\\\\nDuring the hearing, the SEC discussed a recent ruling on Terraform Labs that concluded it sold digital assets as securities without registration. The decision, according to the SEC, provided further grounds for its case against Coinbase.\\\\n\\\\nThe topic was heavily discussed over the hearing. As per SEC attorneys, the cases of Ripple and Terraform Labs may differ from Coinbase\\'s one, but the Howey test applies exactly in the same way.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cOur perspective is they\\\\u2019re identical in terms of the Howey test that applies,\\\\\" said the SEC. \\\\\"We think Coinbase is trying to create a different Howey test for when the people at this table might sell the tokens to each other on its platform and when Terraform might sell its tokens on Coinbase\\\\u2019s platform.\\\\n\\\\nAnd we think that\\\\u2019s just wrong, your honor.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nCoinbase\\\\u2019s legal team argued that Terraform Labs\\\\u2019 case did not involve secondary market transactions, such as the ones conducted on the Coinbase platform. Another key difference appointed in court is that, in Terraform Labs\\' dispute, investors and the company were in a private relationship.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cBut the Terraform case, first of all, as I know the court knows, did not involve secondary market transactions,\\\\\" they argued.\\\\n\\\\nThere were no secondary market transactions in that case. [...] Those were all situations where there was a relationship between the investor and the promoter.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, Coinbase counsel explored the legal requirements for establishing an investment contract under U.S. law, which requires a type of financial arrangement where an individual invests money in a venture managed by another party with the expectation of earning a profit.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"An investment contract, at a minimum, requires the contracting parties to agree or scheme together that the contractee will invest in the contractor\\\\u2019s profit-seeking endeavor.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Coinbase, users trading tokens on its platform may or may not seek profit on the investment, as tokens can also be acquired for their utility. Judge Failla added that investors can purchase tokens because they are \\\\u201ccool\\\\u201d or because a friend owns them.\\\\n\\\\nRipple, stocks and more talks over secondary market transactions\\\\n\\\\nCoinbase argued that token holders don\\'t receive dividends or have legal rights over a project just because they own tokens, which is different from stocks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"A stock reflects an interest in the permanent capital of a corporation. And when it trades, that interest in the permanent capital of the corporation, which is a participation in its capital structure, transferred in entirety from one holder to another holder.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe discussion over stocks and crypto tokens stemmed from Ripple\\\\u2019s ruling from July 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres granted a summary judgment in favor of Ripple Labs, determining that the XRP token is not a security when sold via programmatic sales on exchanges. However, Judge Torres also found that XRP was a security when sold to institutional investors, aligning with the criteria of the Howey Test.\\\\n\\\\nRelated: Coinbase refutes Senator Warren\\\\u2019s government insider allegations\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The critical takeaway there is that Judge Torres recognized that secondary market token purchases of XRP were not investing in Ripple. And in that sense, it rejected what I think is a core portion of the Commission\\'s argument before the court today, which is its investment in an ecosystem, at least with respect to transactions between strangers, where no relationship exists, where no obligations travel.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nIn Coinbase\\'s view, blind trades between individuals on its platform does not constitute an investment agreement.\\\\n\\\\nThe SEC sued Coinbase on June 6, 2023, alleging that the cryptocurrency exchange violated federal securities laws. The agency argued that 13 tokens listed on the exchange were securities, including coins like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Filecoin (FIL), The Sandbox (SAND), Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), Flow (FLOW), Internet Computer (ICP), NEAR (NEAR), Voyager (VGX), Dash (DASH) and Nexo (NEXO).\\\\n\\\\nMagazine: Crypto regulation \\\\u2014 Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?\"}, {\"id\": 11906, \"title\": \"CMS Finalizes Rule to Expand Access to Health Information and Improve the Prior Authorization Process\", \"text\": \"Final rule modernizes the health care system and reduces patient and provider burden by streamlining the prior authorization process\\\\n\\\\nAs part of the Biden-Harris Administration\\\\u2019s ongoing commitment to increasing health data exchange and strengthening access to care, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) finalized the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Final Rule (CMS-0057-F) today. The rule sets requirements for Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations, Medicaid and the Children\\\\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) fee-for-service (FFS) programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and issuers of Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) offered on the Federally-Facilitated Exchanges (FFEs), (collectively \\\\u201cimpacted payers\\\\u201d), to improve the electronic exchange of health information and prior authorization processes for medical items and services. Together, these policies will improve prior authorization processes and reduce burden on patients, providers, and payers, resulting in approximately $15 billion of estimated savings over ten years.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cWhen a doctor says a patient needs a procedure, it is essential that it happens in a timely manner,\\\\u201d said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. \\\\u201cToo many Americans are left in limbo, waiting for approval from their insurance company. Today the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing strong action that will shorten these wait times by streamlining and better digitizing the approval process.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cCMS is committed to breaking down barriers in the health care system to make it easier for doctors and nurses to provide the care that people need to stay healthy,\\\\u201d said CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. \\\\u201cIncreasing efficiency and enabling health care data to flow freely and securely between patients, providers, and payers and streamlining prior authorization processes supports better health outcomes and a better health care experience for all.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nWhile prior authorization can help ensure medical care is necessary and appropriate, it can sometimes be an obstacle to necessary patient care when providers must navigate complex and widely varying payer requirements or face long waits for prior authorization decisions. This final rule establishes requirements for certain payers to streamline the prior authorization process and complements the Medicare Advantage requirements finalized in the Contract Year (CY) 2024 MA and Part D final rule, which add continuity of care requirements and reduce disruptions for beneficiaries. Beginning primarily in 2026, impacted payers (not including QHP issuers on the FFEs) will be required to send prior authorization decisions within 72 hours for expedited (i.e., urgent) requests and seven calendar days for standard (i.e., non-urgent) requests for medical items and services. For some payers, this new timeframe for standard requests cuts current decision timeframes in half. The rule also requires all impacted payers to include a specific reason for denying a prior authorization request, which will help facilitate resubmission of the request or an appeal when needed. Finally, impacted payers will be required to publicly report prior authorization metrics, similar to the metrics Medicare FFS already makes available.\\\\n\\\\nThe rule also requires impacted payers to implement a Health Level 7 (HL7\\\\u00ae) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR\\\\u00ae) Prior Authorization application programming interface (API), which can be used to facilitate a more efficient electronic prior authorization process between providers and payers by automating the end-to-end prior authorization process. Medicare FFS has already implemented an electronic prior authorization API, demonstrating the efficiencies other payers could realize by implementing such an API. Together, these new requirements for the prior authorization process will reduce administrative burden on the healthcare workforce, empower clinicians to spend more time providing direct care to their patients, and prevent avoidable delays in care for patients.\\\\n\\\\nIn response to feedback received on multiple rules and extensive stakeholder outreach HHS will be announcing the use of enforcement discretion for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) X12 278 prior authorization transaction standard to further promote efficiency in the prior authorization process. Covered entities that implement an all-FHIR-based Prior Authorization API pursuant to the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Final Rule (CMS-0057-F) who do not use the X12 278 standard as part of their API implementation will not be enforced against under HIPAA Administrative Simplification, thus allowing limited flexibility for covered entities to use a FHIR-only or FHIR and X12 combination API to meet the requirements of the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization final rule. Covered entities may also choose to make available an X12-only prior authorization transaction. HHS will continue to evaluate the HIPAA prior authorization transaction standards for future rulemaking.\\\\n\\\\nCMS is also finalizing API requirements to increase health data exchange and foster a more efficient health care system for all. CMS values public input and considered the comments submitted by the public, including patients, providers, and payers, in finalizing the rule. Informed by these public comments, CMS is delaying the dates for compliance with the API policies from generally January 1, 2026, to January 1, 2027. In addition to the Prior Authorization API, beginning January 2027, impacted payers will be required to expand their current Patient Access API to include information about prior authorizations and to implement a Provider Access API that providers can use to retrieve their patients\\\\u2019 claims, encounter, clinical, and prior authorization data. Also informed by public comments on previous payer-to-payer data exchange policies, we are requiring impacted payers to exchange, with a patient\\\\u2019s permission, most of those same data using a Payer-to-Payer FHIR API when a patient moves between payers or has multiple concurrent payers.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, the rule also adds a new Electronic Prior Authorization measure for eligible clinicians under the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) Promoting Interoperability performance category and eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) in the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program to report their use of payers\\\\u2019 Prior Authorization APIs to submit an electronic prior authorization request. Together, these policies will help to create a more efficient prior authorization process and support better access to health information and timely, high-quality care.\\\\n\\\\nThe final rule is available to review here: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cms-0057-f.pdf.\\\\n\\\\nThe fact sheet for this final rule is available here: https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/cms-interoperability-and-prior-authorization-final-rule-cms-0057-f.\\\\n\\\\n###\"}, {\"id\": 11907, \"title\": \"Homebuilder sentiment surges amid sharp drop in mortgage rates\", \"text\": \"Confidence among builders in the U.S. housing market rose in January for the second straight month as high mortgage rates continued to fall.\\\\n\\\\nThe National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, which measures the pulse of the single-family housing market , rose five points to 44, more than expected.

(Photo by Celal Gunes/Anadolu via Getty Images) Celal Gunes | Anadolu | Getty Images\\\\n\\\\nThis week\\'s Federal Reserve meeting is likely to mark a substantial turning point for policymakers who have spent the past two years battling runaway inflation. That there\\'s virtually no chance central bank policymakers will vote to raise rates is beside the point: What is likely to occur when the Federal Open Market Committee session wraps up Wednesday is a policy turn away from aggressive rate hikes and toward plans for what happens next. \\\\\"This would be the third straight meeting where the Fed remained on hold and, in our view, means that the Fed likely sees itself as done with the hiking cycle,\\\\\" Michael Gapen, U.S. economist at Bank of America, said in a client note. While acknowledging that future accelerations in inflation could force the Fed to raise rates further, \\\\\"we think that a cooling economy is more likely and that the narrative should shift in the direction of cuts over hikes in 2024,\\\\\" Gapen added. That move to cuts, though likely expressed in a subtle way, would represent a major pivot for the Fed after 11 interest rate hikes. Along with an announcement on rates, the Fed also will update its projections on economic growth, inflation and unemployment. Chair Jerome Powell also will deliver his usual post-meeting news conference, where he either could discuss a strategy to ease policy now that inflation is decelerating, or continue to talk tough, an outcome that could rattle markets. Here\\'s a quick rundown in what to expect:\\\\n\\\\nThe statement\\\\n\\\\nIn its post-meeting communique, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee almost certainly will say that it is holding its benchmark overnight borrowing rate in a range between 5.25%-5.5%. There also could be some language tweaks on the committee\\'s assessment of employment, inflation, housing and overall economic growth. For instance, Bank of America thinks the committee might drop its reference to \\\\\"additional policy firming\\\\\" and simply say that it is committed to getting inflation back down to 2%. Likewise, Goldman Sachs sees a possibility that the statement excludes a characterization regarding tighter financial conditions and possibly make a few other small changes that had been used to convey a bias toward raising rates. Financial conditions, a matrix of economic variables and stock market prices, have loosened considerably since the last Fed meeting concluded on Nov. 1. \\\\\"A pause is all but guaranteed,\\\\\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \\\\\"But I wouldn\\'t be surprised if there was, if not in the statement then during the presser, a bit of pushback on what has been a loosening of financial conditions. \\\\u2026 Powell is going to have to address that.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe dot plot\\\\n\\\\nIf there is a nod toward looming rate cuts, it will happen in the Fed\\'s closely watched grid of individual members\\' expectations known as the \\\\\"dot plot.\\\\\" Markets watch the \\\\\"median dot,\\\\\" or the midpoint of all members\\' projections for the next three years as well as the longer term. One immediate change to the chart will be the removal of a previously indicated rate increase this year. Beyond that, market pricing is aggressive. Traders in the fed funds futures space are pricing rate decreases to start in May 2024 and continue until the Fed has lopped off at least a full percentage point from the key rate before the end of the year, according to CME Group calculations. \\\\\"That\\'s going to be very important, because a good portion of the surge in equities has been predicated on a dovish pivot, with rate cuts coming,\\\\\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. \\\\\"If they acquiesce and agree even slightly with the market, the market is going to surge higher and higher.\\\\\" However, most strategists and economists on Wall Street see a more cautious approach. Goldman Sachs, for instance, pulled forward its expectation for the first cut, but only to the third quarter of next year, well out of line with market pricing. \\\\\"A lot would have to happen for them to go that soon,\\\\\" Goldman chief economist Jan Hatzius recently said on CNBC. \\\\\"The second half of the year is more realistic than the first half.\\\\\" \\\\\"I\\'m not saying it\\'s not going to happen, I just think it\\'s premature based on the current collection of data points,\\\\\" Schwab\\'s Sonders added. \\\\\"Ultimately, maybe the bond market is right [about rate cuts], but probably not without some economic pain between now and March.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe economic outlook\\\\n\\\\nEach quarter, FOMC members also release their projections for key economic variables: gross domestic product, inflation as gauged through the Commerce Department\\'s core personal consumption expenditures price index, and unemployment . In September, the committee indicated slowing GDP growth, a small uptick in unemployment and a gradual drift for inflation back to the Fed\\'s target by 2026. Those numbers shouldn\\'t change much. Goldman expects \\\\\"a small upward revision\\\\\" on GDP and slight downward projections for unemployment and core PCE inflation.

       "  'text': 'In this article VKTX Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\\n\\nStill life of Wegovy an injectable prescription weight loss medicine that has helped people with obesity. It should be used with a weight loss plan and physical activity. Michael Siluk | UCG | Getty Images\\n\\nBoehringer Ingelheim\\n\\nBoehringer Ingelheim is developing a weight loss drug with Danish biotech firm Zealand Pharma. That company has been working on obesity treatments for nearly a decade. Their experimental drug works by targeting two gut hormones: GLP-1 to suppress appetite, and glucagon to increase energy expenditure. Some popular weight loss drugs such as Novo Nordisk\\'s Wegovy only target GLP-1. Boehringer Ingelheim in August said it was moving the drug, called survodutide, into a late-stage study, bringing it one step closer to potential Food and Drug Administration approval. A mid-stage trial found patients who are overweight or have obesity lost up to 19% of their weight after 46 weeks of treatment with the drug. That weight loss could be closer to 20% to 25% in a phase three trial, Zealand Pharma said ahead of the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference last week. It\\'s unclear when that product could win approval.\\n\\nTerns Pharmaceuticals\\n\\nSmaller drugmakers are developing their own weight loss drugs. They could eventually enter the market through a buyout or partnerships with large pharmaceutical companies. Those companies include Terns Pharmaceuticals, which is much earlier in the development process than Boehringer Ingelheim is. The company is conducting an early-stage trial examining its oral weight loss drug, which works by targeting GLP-1, in patients who are overweight or obese. Oral drugs will likely be easier for patients to take and for companies to manufacture compared to the existing weight loss injections. Terns Pharmaceuticals expects to release initial 28-day data from that trial in the second half of 2024, the company\\'s head of research and development, Erin Quirk, said during the conference. Quirk acknowledged that it may be difficult for Terns to set its pill apart from other weight loss drugs. But she added that \"even if it\\'s not the best…analysts are out there predicting that this could be $100 billion market. If you get a 1% piece of that, that\\'s a $1 billion drug, right?\"\\n\\nSmall biotech companies make moves\\n\\nOther small drugmakers trying to enter the space include Viking Therapeutics, which is developing drugs that target GLP-1 and another hormone called GIP. Those are the same hormones that Eli Lilly\\'s weight loss and diabetes drugs, Zepbound and Mounjaro, target. Viking Therapeutics expects to release mid-stage trial data on its weight loss injection in the first half of the year. An early-stage study on that drug showed that it caused up to 7.8% weight loss after 28 days. The company is also slated to release phase one trial data on an oral version of its weight loss drug during the first quarter of the year. Structure Therapeutics is similarly developing an obesity pill, which missed Wall Street\\'s expectations for weight loss in a mid-stage trial last month. The oral drug helped obese patients lose roughly 5% of their weight compared to patients who received a placebo after eight weeks. Before that data was published, Jefferies analyst Roger Song had said he was expecting 6% to 7% weight loss relative to a placebo. Structure said it expects full 12-week results on patients with obesity in the second quarter of this year.

       "  'title': 'Nio stock price forecast: analysis as it breaks key support',\n",
       "  'text': 'Nio (NYSE: NIO) stock price is in its third consecutive week in the red as concerns about the EV industry continued. The stock crashed to a low of $6.55 on Tuesday and is now sitting at its lowest level since June 2020. It has fallen sharply from its all-time high of $67, which it reached in January 2021.\\n\\nEV bubble and saturation\\n\\nCopy link to section\\n\\nNio and other EV companies are not doing well. Tesla, often seen as the gold standard of the sector, has crashed by over 28% from its highest point in 2023. It has also been overtaken by Byd and forced to slash prices in a bid to gain market share and hit its production target.\\n\\nAt the same time, smaller EV companies like Mullen Automotive, Canoo, and Fisker are incinerating cash. The sector is also going through a period of saturation as most companies boost their vehicle production.\\n\\nNio is caught up in this challenge as well, which explains why its stock has plunged while its short interest has jumped to over 15%. This is a sign that many investors still believe that the stock has more downside to go.\\n\\nNio’s challenge is that it specializes on China, a market that has become highly saturated from brands like Xpeng, Li Auto, Byd, and Tesla. It is also facing significant competition challenges in Europe, where Chinese companies are aiming to gain share.\\n\\nFeatured Broker Looking to invest?

Open your account Ad\\n\\nIn 2023, the EU started a review of China’s EV subsidies and how they will affect their industry. The concern in Europe is that companies like Nio and Byd are highly subsidised in China, making them cheaper than those made in the region.\\n\\nAre you looking for fast-news, hot-tips and market analysis? Sign-up for the Invezz newsletter, today.\\n\\nNio has continued to boost its deliveries in the past few months. It delivered 18,012 vehicles in December, a 13.9% YoY increase. It was the third straight month that its deliveries jumped. In all, Nio delivered 160,038 vehicles in 2023, up by 30.7%.\\n\\nNio has also raised cash recently from CYVN, a company based in Abu Dhabi. This $2.2 billion deal gives the company good access to a region that is growing exponentially, helped by tourism, finance, and energy sectors. These funds mean that Nio will likely not need any more funds in the foreseeable future.\\n\\nThe other challenge the company is facing is that its margins have thinned. It had a gross margin of 8% in Q3, down from 13.3% in the same period in 2022. It blamed this to vehicle margins as the company joined other EVs to slash prices.\\n\\nNio stock price forecast\\n\\nCopy link to section\\n\\nNIO chart by TradingView\\n\\nTurning to the weekly chart, we see that the Nio share price has been in a strong downward trend in the past few months. Its performance this week was notable since the stock managed to move below the key support at $7, the lowest swing on May 30th. This is a sign that bears have prevailed, as I wrote in December.\\n\\nNio’s stock has remained below the descending trendline, which connects its highest points since February 2022. It has remained below the 50-week and 100-week Exponential Moving Averages (EMA).\\n\\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also moved below the neutral point of 50. Therefore, the outlook for the stock is bearish, with the next point to watch being at the psychological level of $5, which is about 23% below the current level.'}]"
